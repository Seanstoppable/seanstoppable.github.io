_AMD vulnerabilities spark controversy_. Security research firm CT Labs turned
heads this week after publicly disclosing [a number of AMD vulnerabilities on
very short
notice](https://blog.ensilo.com/amd-chimera-ryzenfall-fallout-masterkey-vulnerability-explained/).
CT Labs defends their actions by [suggesting responsible disclosure is
broken](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/researchers-who-found-amd-cpu-flaws-explain-chaotic-disclosure/),
and trying to find a balance between 0-day notice, and full technical
disclosure. The exploits themselves appear to require admin access to the
machines, but still potential cause of worry since they could result in
persistent threats outside of the regular operating system.

_More Enigma 2018 Roundup_. Lots of content from Enigma and just had to share
some more!
  * [Anatomy of Account Takeover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2a4fRalshI)
    from Google Security. They apparently collected 4K data breach dumps with
    3.3B credits in *2016*. In comparison, at time of writing, HaveIBeenPwned
    has ~5B credentials from 271 breaches sites over all time.
    They break down the risk from breaches vs keyloggers vs phishing, as well as
    investigate the low adoption of additional security measures by users, and
    go over what additional steps they do to try to protect their millions of
    users.
  * [Insecurity In Information
    Technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qU0d_hoidc). About moving
    beyond a culture of blame or overwhelming people with information of varying
    actionability and engaging and empowering developers such that they embrace 
    "Security is Everyone's Job".
  * [Surfing the Motivation Wave to Create Security Behavior
    Change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdTqLjPg2gA). More on understanding
    and trying to influence positive vs negative behavioral changes within a
    company.

_Mobile malware adopts sandbox evasion_. At a recent security conference a
member of Google Play's security team went into how mobile apps are [trying to
avoid
detection](https://duo.com/decipher/how-attackers-try-to-outmaneuver-googles-play-security-efforts).
The examples decribed appear to be similar to sandbox evasion, where depending
on the environment the malware will perform different actions.

_NSA tools reveal known unknowns_. One security researcher has been fascinated
with exploring the tools leaked by the Shadow Brokers last year. In particular,
he is trying to figure out [what threats the NSA may have known
about](https://www.wired.com/story/nsa-leak-reveals-agency-list-enemy-hackers/),
compared to what threats we currently know about. So far, he has found
references to malware we know about, but NSA's knowledge predates public
knowledge significantly, as well as some references he is currently unable to
match against public samples.

_How To Stop Me From Harvesting Sensitive Information From Your Site_. In
January, we
[posted](https://seanstoppable.github.io/2018/01/11/security-roundup-2018-01-11)
about a hypothetical plan to steal sensitive information via pervasive
javascript plugins. The author has now followed up with what things you can do
to [mitigate the potential
threat](https://hackernoon.com/part-2-how-to-stop-me-harvesting-credit-card-numbers-and-passwords-from-your-site-844f739659b9).
It is partially a threat modeling exercise, with the key takeaway being "perhaps
you shouldn't use third party javascript in cases where you are collecting
sensitive information".

_Cryptominers the new Malware?_. More and more reports surface of malware
authors installing cryptominers, rather than engaging in activities like
ransomware. For last year we had
[Adylkuzz](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/adylkuzz-cryptocurrency-mining-malware-spreading-for-weeks-via-eternalblue-doublepulsar),
a cryptominer that spread vua the EternalBlue vulnerability. Fast forward to
this week where we have
[Smominru](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/smominru-monero-mining-botnet-making-millions-operators)
a mining malware that is reported to have made its authors millions in Monero,
again leveraging EternalBlue. Not to mention
[DDG](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mining-botnet-targeting-redis-and-orientdb-servers-made-almost-1-million/)
a mining botnet targeting database servers (presumably with the expectation of
more resources to mine).
What makes this much more attractive for attackers
is simple -  cryptocurrency requires no action on behalf of the user, is much
more stealthy than encrypting stuff, and yet still has a payoff via
Cryptocurrency.

_Flash 0-day makes the rounds_. Still using Flash? Be aware of a Flash 0-day
[currently being
exploited](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/02/attackers-exploiting-unpatched-flaw-in-flash/).
The twist is that the Flash content is being delivered  via specially
crafted Microsoft Office documents, rather than directly in the browser. The
browser still comes into play once the content is executed, so the simplest
defense is to disable flash everywhere, especially since many users [have out of
date versions
installed](https://duo.com/blog/no-patch-yet-flash-vulnerability-exploited-in-the-wild).

_Tech support scammers spam AV company_. MalwareBytes experienced a bit of forum
spam last week, and ended up tracking it back to a tech support scam. A dive
into tech support scams
[ensues](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/social-engineering-cybercrime/2018/02/boomerang-spam-bombs-malwarebytes-forum-not-smart-move/).

_Abusing TLS extensions for fun and exfiltration_. When is a TLS handshake not a
handshake? When it is being used to exflitrate data [proved some security
researchers](https://threatpost.com/covert-data-channel-in-tls-dodges-network-perimeter-protection/129779/).
By leveraging TLS extensions, a malicious user would potentially be able to pass
information and avoid the types of perimiter checks that currently exist.

_Don't forget the small vulnerabilities!_ Why is it important to limit attack
surface? Because even 'small' vulnerabilities could be [chained to create bigger
vulnerabilities](https://blog.detectify.com/2018/02/06/small-vulnerabilities/),
as Detectify blogs about a few examples.

_Why I won't whitelist your site_. Use an ad-blocker? VP of Content Strategy for
O'reilly Media Mike Loukides goes into why *he* used an ad-blocker and won't
whitelist sites. It all comes down to [malware via
ads](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/why-i-wont-whitelist-your-site) and no one in
the industry wanting to take responsibility for any damages.

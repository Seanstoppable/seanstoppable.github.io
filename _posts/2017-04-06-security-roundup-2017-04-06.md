LastPass had [another issue last
week](https://blog.lastpass.com/2017/03/security-update-for-the-lastpass-extension.html/).
While this is unfortunate, Troy Hunt goes into [why password managers are
ultimately
better](https://www.troyhunt.com/password-managers-dont-have-to-be-perfect-they-just-have-to-be-better-than-not-having-one/).
Summary: the best password is a long one you don't actually know vs systems that
are easy to remember. XKCD contributes [it's own set of security
tips](https://xkcd.com/1820/), likely prompted by this recent issue as well.

I've talked about Google's "Potentially Harmful App" detection before, but this
week they go into [how they detected one installed on a few dozen
devices](https://security.googleblog.com/2017/04/an-investigation-of-chrysaor-malware-on.html).
Of note, this app was never available in the Play App store.

An IIS 6.0 zero day has been revealed to have been in play since mid-2016.
Unfortunately, while IIS 6.0 reached end of life in mid-2015, it seems (there
are still [plenty of installs in the
wild](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/04/03/unpatched-zero-day-flaw-in-iis-6-0-leaves-users-with-limited-options/).
Shodan.io shows ~600K entries per their [latest
scans](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=Microsoft-IIS%2F6.0).

Some really fun IoT exploits this week. One involves [injecting attack
code](https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/03/smart-tv-hack-embeds-attack-code-into-broadcast-signal-no-access-required/)
into the broadcast stream, which allows attackers to take over some smart TVs.

Project Zero has found an exploit for [certain wifi
chipsets](https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/04/project-zero-uncovers-a-nasty-wi-fi-chip-exploit/)
that allow wifi drive by takeovers of devices. Patches are already available,
but an overall hardware fix will [take a few
months](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-and-apple-issue-security-updates-for-critical-broadcom-wifi-vulnerabilities/).

Finally, security researchers have taken a look at Samsung's [open source Tizen
operating
system](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/04/samsungs-tizen-is-riddled-with-security-flaws-amateurishly-written/),
used by the company for many IoT devices and found a bevy of security problems.

Threat Intelligence researchers have noticed that users are [uploading plenty of
sensitive
documents](https://threatpost.com/malware-scanning-services-containers-for-sensitive-business-information/124802/)
to malware scanning services, using them in a sense as antivirus without
thinking about how these files are available to researchers. The researcher in
question found a number of interesting files, from private keys to confidential
business plans.

A new version of Mirai has apparently raised its head, having [slammed a college
network for 52
hours](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-mirai-botnet-slams-us-college-with-54-hour-ddos-attack/)
in late February.

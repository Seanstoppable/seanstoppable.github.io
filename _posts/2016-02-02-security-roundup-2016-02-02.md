Using a default password for your device sucks. TP-LINK chose not to do this, 
but ended up [using a unique password that their device 
broadcasts](http://hackaday.com/2016/01/27/tp-links-wifi-defaults-to-worst-unique-passwords-ever/). 
I actually have one of these, and did not make the connection when originally 
setting it up.

Default app on LG G3 phone [doesn't validate 
data](https://threatpost.com/data-theft-hole-identified-in-lg-g3-smartphones/116079/), 
allowing arbitrary Javascript to run code, including system code. Demonstrates 
the importance of validating user supplied data.

Patchwork Security tries [monitoring Heroku dynos for security 
upgrades](https://patchworksecurity.com/blog/). Initial findings are things are 
not upgraded quickly, but overall observation window is quite small.

Norse Corp seems to be imploding, and Krebs has a some details, [including a 
History of Norse Corp](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/01/sources-security-firm-norse-corp-imploding/). 
Some fun comments on [this Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11002616).

NSA TAO Chief talks about [Disrupting Nation State 
Hackers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDJb8WOJYdA) at 
[Engima 2016](https://www.usenix.org/conference/enigma2016). He goes into ways 
at which they will exploit networks, which he generalizes as 'knowing a network 
better than the people who set it up', 'Poke and prod it, just like an adversary 
would do'

User figures out [how Shodan.io is discovering and scanning IPv6 
addresses](http://netpatterns.blogspot.de/2016/01/the-rising-sophistication-of-network.html).
Looks like they have added nodes to the NTP pool, and are harvesting IP 
addresses for requesting servers to figure out what ones to scan. Looks like 
Check Point has [classified Shodan as a 
threat](http://blog.checkpoint.com/2016/01/04/check-point-threat-alert-shodan/) 
and has made attempts to thwart scans.

Security breach [causes woes for TalkTalk](http://www.engadget.com/2016/02/02/talktalk-customer-loss-hack/), as 95K subscribers tied to last year's attack have cancelled their service.

Robin Hood hacking continues, as part of the [Dridex] (https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA15-286A) network has apparently been [hacked to serve up anti-malware](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/02/04/dridex_botnet_pwned/). On the flip-side, Malwarebytes has announced a [vulnerability in their Anti-malware server](https://blog.malwarebytes.org/news/2016/02/malwarebytes-anti-malware-vulnerability-disclosure/) such that an attacker could insert arbitrary code on client machines.

More network security hardware news as arbitrary upload and path traversal problems have been discovered in [Netgear's Prosafe system](https://threatpost.com/netgear-management-system-vulnerable-to-rce-path-traversal-attacks/116139/).

Archive.org has opened up their [Malware Museum](https://archive.org/details/malwaremuseum?sort=-publicdate), a collection of output of malware from the 80s and 90s.

[Schmoocon](http://shmoocon.org/) recently wrapped up, and presentation [videos are now available](https://archive.org/details/shmoocon-2016).

The Magento e-commerce platform has become a major target for hackers. Common attacks attempt to harvest credit card numbers, as Magento checkout [isn't PCI compliant by default](https://blog.sucuri.net/2016/02/theft-over-tls-or-illusion-of-pci-compliance.html).

_Telegram 0-day used to install malware_. Security researchers at Kaspersky go
into a Telegram 0-day, where attackers used special non-printing characters to
convince users they were opening images, when they [were in fact executing
malicious
javascript](https://securelist.com/zero-day-vulnerability-in-telegram/83800/).
The resulting malware then used Telegram as a C&C as well as launching bitcoin
miners, the monitization strategy du jour.

_Low powered encryption chip solution to IoT woes?_. Part of the reason a number
of connected devices are insecure is the power usage associated with running
cryptographic functions, and device providers primary focus on utility over
security. One of those reasons may dissapear soon as MIT is [working on a new
low power crytopgraphic
processor](https://www.engadget.com/2018/02/13/mit-low-power-encryption-chip-internet-of-things-secure/),
which uses less energy and is faster than software solutions.

_DoubleDoor penetrates DoubleDeep_. Botnets are evolving with the existence of
DoubleDoor, a botnet that [uses two exploits to more fully compromise the
target](https://blog.newskysecurity.com/doubledoor-iot-botnet-bypasses-firewall-as-well-as-modem-security-using-two-backdoor-exploits-88457627306d).
The first is an exploit to gain access to the firewall, giving the attacker
internal access. The second uses their vntage point to exploit the target's
modem, in an attempt to be more persistent.

_Thousands of websites impacted by domain hijack_. Web hosting provider Newtek
landed in some trouble, when [three of their core domains
hijacked](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/02/domain-theft-strands-thousands-of-web-sites/),
including one that customers used to manage their own sites.

_Jumping the (air)gap_. There are a number of interesting/esoteric ways in which
someone can exfiltrate data off of computers, but [using magnetic signals to
breach faraday
cages](https://boingboing.net/2018/02/07/modechai-guri-the-guy-who-get.html) is
a new one. While some extreme closeness to the device is still necessary, it is
interesting in the ways that researchers are leveraging all the hardware and the
physical properties they exert to do the unexpected.

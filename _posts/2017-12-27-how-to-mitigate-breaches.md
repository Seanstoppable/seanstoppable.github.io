Having finished talking to Congress about data breaches, Troy Hunt has started a
five part series of articles on how to fix them.

* Part one is all about
  [Education](https://www.troyhunt.com/fixing-data-breaches-part-1-education/),
  where the majority of breaches have involved a human element, whether it is
  just bad coding, and the sooner a human can recognize apossible security
  problem and fix it, the cheaper that fix is likely to be. 
* Part two covers [Reducing Breach
  Impact](https://www.troyhunt.com/fixing-data-breaches-part-2-data-ownership-minimisation/),
  covering the vast swaths of data companies collect but and their desire to
  collect as much information as necessary. However, what is initially thought
  of as an asset could instead be seen as a liability in the event that the data
  is disclosed in a breach. For example, the Expirian leak was that much more
  horrible since it included credit card numbers and drivers licenses. Troy
  argues for data minimization and expiration, to protect users data.
* Part three covers [Ease of
  Disclosure](https://www.troyhunt.com/fixing-data-breaches-part-3-the-ease-of-disclosure/),
  making it easy for people (whether security practitioners, a reporter, or a
  random individual) contact you in order to disclose a security issue, with
  reasonable assumption that you will be receptive, rather than litigous.
* Part four covers [Bug
  Bounties](https://www.troyhunt.com/fixing-data-breaches-part-4-bug-bounties/),
  not just making it easy for people to report vulnerabilities, but ACTIVELY
  ENCOURAGING THEM TO and offering some renumeration incentive for disclosure to
  you vs to the black market.
* Part five covers
  [Penalties](https://www.troyhunt.com/fixing-data-breaches-part-5-penalties/),
  making the financial impact of a data breach matter to the bottom line, such
  that the ROI of security becomes much more serious.

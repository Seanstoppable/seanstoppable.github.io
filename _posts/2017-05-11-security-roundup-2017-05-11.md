Microsoft rushed out with a critical fix to their Malware Protection Engine,
releasing the fix one day before their regular 'Patch Tuesday' cycle. The
exploit resulted in a specially crafted file to have [Malware Protection Engine
execute the
malware](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/05/emergency-fix-for-windows-anti-malware-flaw-leads-mays-patch-tuesday/). 
A number of other security fixes went out as part of patch Tuesday, including
one that triggers with specially crafted images in Office. Talos Intel has a
breakdown of [all the security
items](http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/05/ms-tuesday.html).

Another day, another billion (yes, with a *b*) user records leaked. Troy Hunt of
[HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) goes over how leaks on one site
allow for credential stuffing, which is attempting to reuse those credentials on
other sites in order to provide more accounts to sell. And, since password reuse
is still fairly common, this results in plenty of hits. Troy details [2 big
combo
lists](https://www.troyhunt.com/password-reuse-credential-stuffing-and-another-1-billion-records-in-have-i-been-pwned/)
of usernames and passwords that have been brought to his attention, containing
the aforementioned billion credentials. Troy also went into [why he doesn't
store passwords for his
service](https://www.troyhunt.com/here-are-all-the-reasons-i-dont-make-passwords-available-via-have-i-been-pwned/).

DUO Labs also got ahold of one of the combo lists and performed [some analysis 
on the
passwords](https://duo.com/blog/a-security-analysis-of-over-500-million-usernames-and-passwords).
Interestingly, 25% of passwords are 9 characters long (better than the 8
characters suggested in the [current draft of NIST
guidelines](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html), but the most common
passwords contained in the list is still pretty bad.

A large scale Signaling System #7 attack took place recently to [intercept 2FA
text
messages](https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/05/thieves-drain-2fa-protected-bank-accounts-by-abusing-ss7-routing-protocol/)
for bank accounts, and drain the account of all funds.

Plenty of states and countries are rolling out disclosure laws. Techcrunch has
an article pointing out this can [paint a target on a company that has
disclosed](https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/09/prevent-data-breaches-dont-just-report-them/?ncid=rss),
but not taken appropriate steps to prevent further breaches.

MalwareBytes write that the [Snake
trojan](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2017/05/snake-malware-ported-windows-mac/),
which has been around since 2008, has been ported to OSX. This
masquerades as a Flash installer, with the added deception of actually
installing flash vs just pretending to install flash.

Google follows up on the first five months of their [Open Source Software
Fuzzing](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/) experiment. In that time period
they have integrated 47 projects (including several SSH and SSL projects), and
discovered 1000+ bugs, of which [264 are potential security
vulnerabilities](https://security.googleblog.com/2017/05/oss-fuzz-five-months-later-and.html).
To further the project, they are now offering financial rewards for projects to
integrate with the process.

A new malware strain came to light this week which [has a remote accessible
API](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cyber-espionage-malware-is-so-advanced-it-has-its-own-api/).
This is interesting in that it allows the botnet to invert the traditional C2
model as required, making it easier for botnet owners to re-establish control
after a C2 takedown.

Handbrake, a popular transcoding app, was hacked to deliver a trojan for [up to
4 days](https://forum.handbrake.fr/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=36364) For those that 
love in depth of what malware is doing under the hood, check out
[Patrick Wardle's blog post](https://objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x1D.html).

Security researchers classify a number of breaches according to the OWASP Top 10. 
[The Results](https://snyk.io/blog/owasp-top-10-breaches/) are interesting,
with 'Known Vulnerable Components' being the cause of 24% of breaches, and
another 15% attributable to causes not in the top 10.

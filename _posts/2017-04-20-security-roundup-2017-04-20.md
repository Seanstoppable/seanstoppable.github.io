The malware industry starts pointing fingers, with this article from Ars
Technica on ['Lawyers, malware, and
money'](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/04/the-mystery-of-the-malware-that-wasnt/).
In it, a number of malware detection services and malware detection benchmark
services largely all blame each other for misrepresenting their products in
demos and sales bakeoffs. Some suggest that the benchmarks are not
representative of the 'real world', others suggest that some people are rigging
the game in their favor, and a number of these disputes have apparently devolved
into lawsuits/revocation of licenses.

The return of the ShadowBrokers has resulted [in another trove of exploits being
released](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2017/04/shadowbrokers-releases-more-stolen-information/).
Apparently, more than 1k Windows Binaries are part of this trove. Microsoft
indicates a number of the vulnerabilities [have already been
fixed](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/msrc/2017/04/14/protecting-customers-and-evaluating-risk/).
There is
[plenty](https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/04/nsa-leaking-shadow-brokers-just-dumped-its-most-damaging-release-yet/)
of [coverage](http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/04/cve-2017-0199.html) from
[multiple](https://community.rapid7.com/community/infosec/blog/2017/04/18/the-shadow-brokers-leaked-exploits-faq)
[security](http://blog.ensilo.com/shadowgroup-reveals-all-initial-analysis-of-the-equation-group-dump) 
sites, for those that want to dig in further.

Phishing is temporarily much easier on Chrome and Firefox, as
[PunyCode](https://www.engadget.com/2017/04/17/google-chrome-phishing-unicode-flaw/)
domains, ones using non-ascii characters, apparently render domain names that
look identical to the ascii versions they are masquerading as.

The recent Struts exploit has been fixed, along with [299 other
vulnerabilities](https://erpscan.com/press-center/blog/analyzing-oracle-security-oracle-critical-patch-update-april-2017/)
in various Oracle products. This number of security fixes is a new record for
Oracle, beating out the 276 reported in July 2016. 

Plenty of Android malware news, where Sophos points out how Android malware is
[taking emulation detection
techniques](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/04/13/android-malware-creators-throw-up-a-roadblock-to-thwart-the-good-guys/)
used in desktop malware to avoid analysis, and Threatpost going into [how Google
is combating
malware](https://threatpost.com/google-making-life-difficult-for-ransomware-to-thrive-on-android/124992/)
on Android. That doesn't stop some malware campaigns from [trying their
hardest to stay in the app
store](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malware-reaches-play-store-as-google-wages-war-against-bankbot-trojan/).

Sucuri has posted [March's Lab
Notes](https://blog.sucuri.net/2017/04/labs-notes-monthly-recap-mar2017.html).
Of interest: Backdoors executed [via
cookies](http://labs.sucuri.net/?note=2017-03-09).

Checkpoint's March [Malware Most
Wanted](http://blog.checkpoint.com/2017/04/13/marchs-wanted-malware-list-exploit-kits-rise-popularity/)
is out showing that, after a recent downturn, exploit kits are once more in
active use.

In a bout of Robin Hood Hacking, a botnet named
[Hajime](https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/04/vigilante-botnet-infects-iot-devices-before-blackhats-can-hijack-them/)
is competing against Mirai. Hajime infects IoT systems and then sets up
protections designed to disrupt Mirai.

The FBI was involved in the recent take down of the Kelhios
Botnet. Threatpost provides some details on [how they were 
involved](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/inside-the-takedown-of-zombie-spider-and-the-kelihos-botnet/), 
while a MalwareTech researcher provides us with [details on Kelhios from his
own research](https://www.malwaretech.com/2017/04/the-kelihos-botnet.html)

Another in depth into malware with
[Sathurbot](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/04/06/sathurbot-distributed-wordpress-password-attack/),
a malware strain that initially spreads through malicious torrents and
attempt to do brute force attacks on common login portals.

Ransomware as a service hits a new low, where a version called Karmen can be
[purchased
outright](https://threatpost.com/low-cost-ransomware-service-discovered/125017/)
for $175 dollars.

Another instance of open source malware made the rounds this week. Labelled as 
a 'remote administration tool', which isn't even a particularly fancy term for 
remote access trojan, this one used Telegram as its C&C. BleepingComputer has
[the
details](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-open-source-rat-uses-telegram-protocol-to-steal-data-from-victims/).

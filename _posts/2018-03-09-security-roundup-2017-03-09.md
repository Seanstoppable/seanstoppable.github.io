_USENIX Enigma 2018 videos_. Missed [USENIX Enigma
2018](https://www.usenix.org/conference/enigma2018)? Videos started [showing
up on
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEj7rL10vd5Zrv1xpD2uxyLYWdIM_KGAb),
so you can catch up on the latest privacy and security research, including
(but not limited to) topics like:
 * [Protecting Firefox Data with Content
 Signatures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdDQdZHDcLw) to better handle
 software upgrades, especially in a world where TLS interception is real.
 * [LISA: A Practical Zero Trust
   Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-NvNJUIUwA), Netflix's version
   of Google's BeyondCorp.
 * [The Future of Cyber-Autonomy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JqsNyyMfNw)
   on using automated techniques to find vulnerabilities, resulting in 13,875
   bugs in all the programs on Debian with 250 of them resulting in shell
   access. These techniques went into 'Mayhem', the winner of the US Cyber Grand
   Challenge in 2016.

_How to break encryption_. Want to know more about how researchers break
ransomware? You may want to start reading MalwareBytes [Encryption 101
series](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2018/03/encryption-101-how-to-break-encryption/),
where this week they go over identifying crypto and finding weaknesses in its
usage.

_Breaking down a RAT_. And for even more malware breakdown, ObjectiveSee [breaks
down a remote access trojan](https://objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x2A.html)
that (at time of writing) was not picked up by AV. This happened due to looking
at VirusTotal for references to a database that was previously exploitable in
OSX (now patched), where several malware authors still check for this exploit.

_Are voting machines truely divorced from the internet?_ This is the question
that a Princeton professor explores in [this
article](https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2018/02/22/are-voting-machine-modems-truly-divorced-from-the-internet/),
since voting machines still have modems. Since this is more like a voice call,
it is possible that there is insulation from the internet, but one problem will
always exist: this communication is still routed, opening the possibility of
some exploit in the pathway allowing an attacker to tap into the communication,
which the US-CERT has [called attention
to](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA16-250A). But the researchers point
out there is an easier way, just use the concept behind the Stingray to act as a
cell tower and MitM the communication path, putting you much closer to your
intended target and more likely for a successful interception.

_New 4G vulnerabilities discovered_. Speaking of mobile network vulnerabilities,
researchers from Purdue and Iowa University have built a tool to scan for 4G
vulnerabilities and [published some of their
results](https://www.hackread.com/hackers-can-send-fake-emergency-alerts-with-4g-lte-flaw/).
Spoilers: attacks exist, and there are several.

_WebUSB undermines physical token security_. WebUSB is a feature that allows
websites to access USB content, ostensibly for things like VR and 3D printers.
However, researchers have used it to [trigger a query to connected 2FA
tokens](https://www.wired.com/story/chrome-yubikey-phishing-webusb/) and, if
combined with tricking the user into entering their password, could be used to
take over accounts otherwise secured by 2FA.

_The history of L0pht_. L0pht was one of the early and influencial hacker groups
of the last 25 years, and Duo has a [4 part
expose](https://duo.com/decipher/an-oral-history-of-the-l0pht) on their history.
In the beginning, it all started with people dialing into BBSes and sharing
information, and then moved to in person to a shared loft space...

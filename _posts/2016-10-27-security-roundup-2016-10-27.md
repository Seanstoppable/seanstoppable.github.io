Biggest news this week is, of course, the big DDoS attacks against Dyn from Mirai
infected electronic devices. Dyn has [provided some details of the
attacks](https://dyn.com/blog/dyn-analysis-summary-of-friday-october-21-attack/),
the first which lasted ~2 hours, and the second of which lasted ~3.5 hours.
Initial analysis leads them to say there were traffic surges 40-50x higher than 
normal. They are not able to confirm independent reports of the size and volume
of the attack at this time.

The rest of the internet is abuzz with commentary:

 * Rapid 7 has put together a [Mirai
   FAQ](https://community.rapid7.com/community/infosec/blog/2016/10/25/mirai-faq-when-iot-attacks). 

 * Incapsular [analyzes the Mirai source
   code](https://www.incapsula.com/blog/malware-analysis-mirai-ddos-botnet.html).
   Includes the password list, what hosts NOT to scan, and attempts to clean out
   other intruders.

 * Krebs provided lots of coverage. Notably, a summary of the [sudden increase in
   DDoS volume](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/ddos-on-dyn-impacts-twitter-spotify-reddit/),
   demonstrating [potential
   ties](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/spreading-the-ddos-disease-and-selling-the-cure/)
   between Mirai and vDOS botnets, as well as new on one chinese electronics 
   firm who [has vowed to issue a  recall for a number of vulnerable devices](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/iot-device-maker-vows-product-recall-legal-action-against-western-accusers/).

 * A Motherboard article suggests that white hat hackers could write a virus to
[hack vulnerable devices and update them such that Mirai no longer
works](https://motherboard.vice.com/read/how-vigilante-hackers-could-stop-the-internet-of-things-botnet). 

 * Meanwhile, some senators are expressing concern that [there is no standards and
no liability for device
manufacturers](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/senator-prods-federal-agencies-on-iot-mess/),
which some hope will cause manufacturers to sit up and self regulate before the
government imposes potentially harsher regulations.

 * Threatpost indicates that only [10% of the devices infected by Mirai may have
   been used in the
   attack](https://threatpost.com/mirai-fueled-iot-botnet-behind-ddos-attacks-on-dns-providers/121475/),
   and that since Mirai went open source, the number of infections has doubled.

In related news, another DDoS mitigation provider has noticed [a growing number
of LDAP servers participating in DDoS
attacks](http://www.computerworld.com/article/3135727/security/attackers-abuse-exposed-ldap-servers-to-amplify-ddos-attacks.html).
As some LDAP server variants work over UDP, this allows attackers to perform UDP
amplification attacks, while hiding the source of the overall attack.

In other news:

[Dirty
Cow](https://threatpost.com/serious-dirty-cow-linux-vulnerability-under-attack/121448/)
also landed on Friday. A nine year old Linux vulnerability that is based on a
race condition that allows people to write to files they don't normally have
permissions for. This, of course, includes files for usernames and passwords to
gain more access to the machine.

Mozilla has already baked in TLS 1.3 support into Firefox, but they have also
announced that they will [turn it on by
default](https://threatpost.com/mozilla-turning-tls-1-3-on-by-default-with-firefox-52/121461/)
March 2017. They join Cloudflare and Google in being proactive about pushing this
new standard forward.

Sucuri has covered a number of credit card stealers for eCommerce sites, and
goes into depth for a specific version they [found infecting Prestashop
instances](https://blog.sucuri.net/2016/10/credentials-stealer-prestashop.html),
as well as one that [impacts
Magento](https://blog.sucuri.net/2016/10/magento-credit-card-swiper-exports-image.html).
The latter is interesting in that it dumps data into image files, and legitimate
looking image files as well, making it harder for people to detect the data
being collected, as well as the data being exfiltrated via a regular file
access.

Breakpoint labs continues their series on how they break into networks. This
week is [Web Application
Vulnerabilities](https://breakpoint-labs.com/webapp-vulns/). Sadly standard
fare, such as failing to update software and plugins, as well as not sanitizing
user inputs.

The DoD is apparently expanding on the 'Hack the Pentagon' initiative and
[launching a more long term bug bounty
program](http://www.eweek.com/security/dod-launching-expanded-hack-the-pentagon-bug-bounty-program.html).

Security researchers have demonstrated [bit flipping attacks on
Android](http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/10/using-rowhammer-bitflips-to-root-android-phones-is-now-a-thing/).
Labelled 'Drummer', it relies on continuously accessing memory to induce an
error state and flip a bit to produce undesired behaviour, enabling apps to do
things like break out of security sandboxes and obtain root permissions on a
device. The research indicates this could even be triggered by javascript in a
browser.

Checkpoint has released the September edition of ['Most Wanted'
Malware](http://blog.checkpoint.com/2016/10/21/septembers-top-wanted-malware-list-ransomware-top-3-first-time/).
Conficker is still #1. Locky has made it to #3, making the first time ransomware
has been in the top 3. ThreatPost indicates that [Locky has at least 10
downloader
variants](https://threatpost.com/locky-ransomware-learns-new-evasive-tricks/121419/)
as of this writing, and still evolves in the way in which it evades detection
and infects systems.

BleepingComputer provides the rest of the [Ransomware Roundup](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-october-21-2016-mbrfilter-click-me-games-and-more/). Some minor new players, but one variant that includes a game, and Talos Intel providing [a tool to block updates to the Master Boot Record](http://blog.talosintel.com/2016/10/mbrfilter.html) to mitigate ransomware attacks that use this strategy.

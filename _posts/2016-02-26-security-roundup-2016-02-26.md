A 'few' things I missed Wednesday.

- Sean

Krebs mentions some increasingly [sophisticated phone scams to Dell customers](http://bit.ly/1LKEkh5). These calls allegedly involve the caller correctly providing unique service tags of Dell equipment, as well as historical service records. Dell currently says their customer data has not been breached.

I think biometric security is a big miss, but that isn't stopping [HSBC from rolling out "Voice ID" to 15 million customers](http://engt.co/1TEgmKX). Meanwhile, looks like the FBI could potentially [use fingerprints of dead people to unlock devices](http://engt.co/1Upsf7X).

Checking input is important! Even [barcode scanners can be subject to string injection attacks](http://bit.ly/1Ru1UmJ).

Wordpress is the new botnet. Simple [exploitation of the pingback XMLRPC command](http://bit.ly/1UpqIiv) allows attackers to flood some target with HTTP requests.

Akamai is rolling out a tool to allow users to [better monitor and analyze bot traffic](http://tcrn.ch/21xWUlK) and take whatever action they want.

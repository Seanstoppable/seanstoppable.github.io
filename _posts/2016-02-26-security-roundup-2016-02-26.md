Krebs mentions some increasingly [sophisticated phone scams to Dell 
customers](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/02/dell-to-customers-report-service-tag-scams/). 
These calls allegedly involve the caller  correctly providing unique service 
tags of Dell equipment, as well as  historical service records. Dell currently 
says their customer data has not been breached.

I think biometric security is a big miss, but that isn't stopping [HSBC from 
rolling out "Voice ID" to 15 million customers](http://engt.co/1TEgmKX). 
Meanwhile, looks like the FBI could potentially [use fingerprints of dead 
people to unlock 
devices](https://www.engadget.com/2016/02/18/fbi-to-use-dead-suspects-fingerprints-to-open-iphones/).

Checking input is important! Even [barcode scanners can be subject to string 
injection attacks](https://hackaday.com/2016/02/17/barcodes-that-hack-devices/).

Wordpress is the new botnet. Simple [exploitation of the pingback XMLRPC 
command](https://blog.sucuri.net/2016/02/wordpress-sites-leveraged-in-ddos-campaigns.html)
allows attackers to flood some target with HTTP requests.

Akamai is rolling out a tool to allow users to [better monitor and analyze bot 
traffic](https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/17/new-akamai-tool-aims-to-bring-bots-under-control/?ncid=rss) 
and take whatever action they want.

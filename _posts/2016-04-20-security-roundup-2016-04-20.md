The Australian Federal Government just announced that the [Bureau of
Meteorology was the target of a cyber attack](http://ab.co/1NlSeMx).
Apparently, they also have a direct link to the Australian Defence
Department, meaning a source of third party risk. The Australian Government
has announced their new Cyber Security Initiative to protect against these
threats.

CBS broke the story about [flaws in the Signaling System Seven]
(http://cbsn.ws/1VCDVXg) that allow people to be tracked. I found this
similar to this Engadget story of [The Untold Story of the Teen Hackers Who
Transformed the Early Internet](http://bit.ly/1WcRevS), again exploiting
telecommunications systems to get unauthorized access to systems.

Companies have been increasingly encrypting all web traffic and the Let's
Encrypt traffic has been helping make it easy. 6 months since they have
launched, they have created more than 1.7 million TLS certificates and are [now
preparing to leave beta](http://bit.ly/1NlJSoj). A number of consumer
platforms like [Dreamhost](http://bit.ly/1STYnfc) and [Wordpress]
(http://bit.ly/20YycdG) have rolled out easy integration for their
customers, making secure communications accessible to the non-technical
savvy. Even [Sucuri has rolled it out as an option for their application
firewall](http://bit.ly/26fGX72).

Meanwhile, Google observes [~16,500 new compromised websites a week]
(http://bit.ly/1rmbjVv). They outline some improvements they have made that
make it easier for up to 75% of those webmasters to re-secure their sites
post compromise.

A recent study demonstrates how you shouldn't share sensitive files [using
URL shorteners](http://bit.ly/26fGhyg). Essentially, the shorter links are
brute forceable, allowing people to potentially access sensitive
information. This study prompted Microsoft to remove this functionality
from OneDrive and Google to lengthen the link and add security precautions
against brute forcing.

MIT recently announced a new [debugging method to detect vulnerabilities]
(http://bit.ly/1pil0ST). Essentially a static analysis of source code, they
were able to detect 23 vulnerabilities in 50 popular Ruby On Rails
platforms in minutes.

Rapid7 combed through the National Vulnerability Database to [put together a
few trends](http://bit.ly/1Sc5fsi). 2015 had a big jump (17%) in critical
vulnerabilities

Last week I mentioned how ransomware is starting to eclipse banking
malware, but the [GozNym malware proves that banking malware is still a
million dollar business](http://bit.ly/1SwpZ0a). New
ransomware include [a variant dubbed Rokku](http://bit.ly/23Kr0a8) which
encrypts each file with a unique key, as well as one called [Jigsaw
which advertises a time limit to decrypt your files](http://ubm.io/22Pbjsg).
For existing malware, TeslaCrypt continues to evolve by [investing heavily in evasion
techniques](http://bit.ly/1SuoGeP) and ThreatPost indicates that [3.2
MILLION servers are impacted by the JBoss flaw](http://bit.ly/1VkNzNM) that
SamSam is exploiting.

Lots of news over the week, so thought I would do a pre-weekend digest.

More and more hardware vulnerability stories:

[Critical Flaws Found In Network Management Services](https://threatpost.com/critical-flaws-found-in-network-management-systems/115649/)

Maybe we should score some companies based on the security of their products? Or at least notify our customers who we know use these products when these things are released?

[Trend Micro security software made passwords vulnerable, allowed remote code execution](http://www.neowin.net/news/trend-micro-security-software-made-passwords-vulnerable-allowed-remote-code-execution)

I mean, seriously, if someone has a product that proved to be a security vulnerability, it makes sense that their security score should be kinda low, right? Especially if it is a security product like a password manager.

[Cisco Patches Hardcoded Password, DOS Vulnerabilities In Software, Devices](https://threatpost.com/cisco-patches-hardcoded-password-dos-vulnerabilities-in-software-devices/115881/)

At least Cisco found these themselves, having launched a code review in the wake of Juniper.

[Advantech EKI Vulnerable To Bypass, Possible Backdoor](https://threatpost.com/advantech-eki-vulnerable-to-bypass-possible-backdoor/115900/)

"Researchers with Rapid 7 pointed out in early December that EKI-1322 was still vulnerable to Shellshock and Heartbleed, bugs that affected machines running Bash, and OpenSSL respectively, in 2014."

[It's Too Easy To Hack The Hospital](http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-hospital-hack/)

Almost missed this article from November. Hackers stealing data through medical devices! Hospital system honeypots! Hacking devices to do lethal things!

And an assortment of other news:

[The CIA Secret To CyberSecurity That No One Seems To Get](http://www.wired.com/2015/12/the-cia-secret-to-cybersecurity-that-no-one-seems-to-get/)

"As Ajay Arora, CEO of file security company Vera, notes, there is no perimeter anymore."

[Password Storage In A Highly Parallel World](https://hynek.me/articles/storing-passwords/)

From compute-hard passwords to memory-hard passwords.

[Papers Please](https://blog.spreedly.com/2015/12/21/papers-please/)

Interesting article on how one organization audits their SSH usage.

[Hacking Team Leak Helped Find 0-Day Vulnerability](http://www.wired.com/2016/01/hacking-team-leak-helps-kaspersky-researchers-find-zero-day-exploit/)

A tale of white hat turning black hat. Hackers being hacked. Monitoring for vulnerabilities based on coding style/reuse.

[The Dragnet](http://www.theverge.com/2016/1/13/10758380/stingray-surveillance-device-daniel-rigmaiden-case)

How one con divined the existence of the Stringray

[Google's Creepy Plan To Kill The Password](http://www.engadget.com/2016/01/15/googles-creepy-plan-to-kill-the-password/)

Using a combination of biometrics, the way you walk, your keystroke patterns, your speech patterns, your face, etc to build a 'trust score' that unlocks your device. Unsure what happens if you totally mess up one of those algorithms by breaking your leg or something. And, I mean, something is going to be storing all that data.

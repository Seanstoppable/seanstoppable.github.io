Verizon has had two communication redirect issues this week. The first is where 
one determined hacker [convinced a Verizon rep to change a phone number to a new 
SIM](https://www.engadget.com/2016/06/10/hacker-hijacks-deray-by-redirecting-his-verizon-phone-number/). 
This allowed the attacker to receive all calls/texts to a phone they controlled, 
intercepting 2 factor auth tokens. Similarly, Verizon recently patched a system 
vulnerability that [would allow attackers to redirect a victim's email to an 
account of their choosing](https://threatpost.com/verizon-patches-serious-email-flaw-that-left-millions-exposed/118661/), 
which would have allowed an attacker to redirect any password reset emails for 
accounts Verizon customers might have associated with their accounts.

TeamViewer has been having a rough time, with a lot of 
their [customers having their machines 
accessed](http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/06/teamviewer-says-theres-no-evidence-of-2fa-bypass-in-mass-account-hack/). 
Speculation abounds around whether these accounts were hacked due to leaked 
passwords via one of the many, many recent breaches or whether TeamViewer has 
had a breach themselves.

Twitter felt the weight of a password leak this week and has already proactively 
started [resetting passwords for some 
accounts](https://blog.twitter.com/2016/keeping-your-account-safe). 
Similar to the TeamViewer incident, the current belief is that these have been 
cross referenced from other breaches. Twitter indicates they are proactively 
cross referencing and resetting accounts as breaches come to light.

iMesh, a company that recently out of business, ALSO had [old breached account 
data surface](http://www.zdnet.com/article/51-million-imesh-file-sharing-accounts-for-sale-dark-web/) 
this week. Based on available records, this break might have occured in 2013 and 
51 million accounts, including passwords which were hashed using MD5.

The Windows Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS), used by Windows to 
asyncronously fetch things like software updates, has been exploited to [infect 
and re-infect systems](https://threatpost.com/windows-bits-notification-feature-used-to-deliver-malware/118555/) 
by leveraging the "notification" feature to schedule persistent updates. As 
BITS is a trusted service, this allowed malware downloads from being triggered 
as potentially malicious activity by some monitoring systems.

That is not the biggest vulnerability that Microsoft has patched though. 
["Badtunnel"](http://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/windows-badtunnel-attack-hijacks-network-traffic/d/d-id/1325875) 
is an escalation attack which can be triggered with a variety of medium and 
allows an attacker to hijack traffic and gain control of remote machines. 
Versions of windows going back to Windows 95 are impacted by this vulnerability.

Krebs has another fascinating/terrifying [update on ATM insert 
skimmers](http://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=34891). This one contains videos of how 
they actually work, and how hard they would be to detect in real life.

Ever wonder how a ransomware-as-a-service ring works? Business insider has an 
[interview with Flashpoint Intel](http://www.businessinsider.com/what-a-russian-hacking-ring-is-like-2016-6), 
who convinced one russian ransomware boss to make them part of his ring.

Similar to the recent abrupt shutdown of TeslaCrypt, it looks like the [Angler 
Exploit Kit has shut down](http://news.softpedia.com/news/all-clues-point-to-the-death-of-the-angler-exploit-kit-505135.shtml), 
with malware campaigns migrating to a variety of other exploit kits.

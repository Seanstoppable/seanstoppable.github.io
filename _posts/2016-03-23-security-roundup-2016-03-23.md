Latest stories for you all!

My co-worker Asim mentions that iMessages are open to a MitM attach where 
attackers can gain enough data and have enough tries to [brute force files from 
Apple's servers](http://bit.ly/1Rf9SS1). One of the researchers has posted an 
[in depth description of the problem](http://bit.ly/22v2B7P).

EFF apparently has a [secure messaging scorecard](http://bit.ly/1UEe3Jz), 
based on factors such as security in transit, security at rest, and whether the 
code is open and has been audited.

Google has announced they are [expanding their certificate transparency 
project](http://bit.ly/1U74vGP) 
to include a log of certificate chains that are no longer trusted by browsers, 
or are pending inclusion into browsers. In additional Google security news, they 
recently announced a [new transparency initiative around their own encryption 
efforts](http://bit.ly/1UEjojS). 
~77% of their traffic is now encrypted.

NIST just released a new draft on [Cryptographic Standards in the Federal 
Government](http://1.usa.gov/1U75Eyf).

Uber just started a bug bounty program, and it looks like they are going to 
[try gamification to keep researchers interested](http://tcrn.ch/1VCzquj) 
in trying to discover problems. Contrast this to the DoD, which started a 
program [requiring researchers to jump through hoops](http://bit.ly/1WH8709) 
to be 'allowed' to look at things. Not on the list? Well, that is apparently 
what legal threats are for. And finally, this years [Pwn2Own has wrapped 
up](http://bit.ly/1py1MZV), 
leading to 21 new browser based vulnerabilities being disclosed.

[Locky AND hospital security](http://bit.ly/1XLDerM)? This appears to be the 
case for the Methodist Hospital in Kentucky. And for those surprised about 
finding hospital devices on the internet, ThreatPost has an article on 
[serial servers with dumb defaults](http://bit.ly/1MlrvPO).... 
these being used to attach medical devices to networks.

Krebs also has an interesting article of spam and malware providers [abusing 
open redirect systems on .gov sites](http://bit.ly/1VCBVwF) 
to make links more trusted.

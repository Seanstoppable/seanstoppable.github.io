_HackerOne 2018 Hacker Report_. HackerOne has produced another version of [their
report around what drives
hackers](https://www.hackerone.com/blog/2018-Hacker-Report). Interestingly,
while filing bug bounties earns hackers in some countries many times the norm of
the average salary there, "to make money" is only the 4th most common reason
hackers do what they do, vs first in 2016. Also interesting, 1 in 4 hackers do
not report vulnerabilites without a clear channel to disclose. Perhaps similarly
to [Troy Hunt's piece on breach
notification](https://www.troyhunt.com/streamlining-data-breach-disclosures-a-step-by-step-process/),
they find the hunt and lack of response frustrating, and instead opt to avoid
it?

_SANS Releases Enterprise Implementation of Bug Bounty Programs_. Thinking of
starting a bug bounty program? You may want to check out SANS Institutes
[Enterprise Implementation
guide](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/application/bug-bounty-programs-enterprise-implementation-38250).

_More malicious extensions found for Google Chrome_. Investigating a suspicious
increase in network traffic, security researchers tracked the uptick back to yet
another more [malicious Chrome
extensions](https://www.icebrg.io/blog/malicious-chrome-extensions-enable-criminals-to-impact-over-half-a-million-users-and-global-businesses).
While the extensions themselves may not have malicious, they were able to
download and execute commands from some remote JSON. Additionally, another
researcher has discovered an extension that is [extremely difficult to
remove](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/01/malicious-chrome-extension-is-next-to-impossible-to-manually-remove/),
circumventing normal attempts to either disable or delete.

_HackerOne releases Hacker101 Security Course_. To further increase the talent
pool, HackerOne has also released a [free Web Security
course](https://www.hackerone.com/blog/Hacker101-Free-class-web-security-Lets-break-some-stuff).
Block off some time for learning!

_IoT Botnets work of the minority?_. Last year marked the rise of several large
botnets powered by IoT devices, and Brian Krebs has opted to talk to Allison
Nixon from Flashpoint security about [her perspectives on the IoT problem and
where are we
going](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/01/expert-iot-botnets-the-work-of-a-vast-minority/).

_SamSam, 2 years later_. We first reported on SamSam almost [2 years
ago](https://seanstoppable.github.io/2016/03/30/security-roundup-2016-03-30),
and Talos has an intel on the [evolution of this ransomware
strain](http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/01/samsam-evolution-continues-netting-over.html).

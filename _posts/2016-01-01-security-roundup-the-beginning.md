Since joining SecurityScorecard, I have been more observant of the security related news that crosses my news feeds. 

Inspired by HighScalability's ['Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability'](http://highscalability.com/), O'Reilley's ['4 Short Links'](http://radar.oreilly.com/four-short-links), and [Trivium](http://chneukirchen.org/trivium/) I decided to share what I believe to be the most interesting pieces with my co-workers, trying to gather stories and track trends.

The result has become a weekly newsletter of sorts, of which you can now find here.

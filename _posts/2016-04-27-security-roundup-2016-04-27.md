Apparently, the Bangladash Bank was hacked recently, and almost taken for
$1 billion dollars! The attack vector? [Cheap network switches]
(http://reut.rs/1rgtknX), providing neither a firewall or the ability to
logically separate network traffic.

The personal info of 93.4 Million Mexicans recently occurred due to a [publicly
exposed database](http://bit.ly/1rguOhT).

In security, humans are the weakest element. In order to make security
training more interesting and memorable, one company has started '[Game Of
Threats](http://tcrn.ch/1VDk3D8)' where teams compete against each other in
a game to learn more about what threats organizations face.

AV products are introducing 'sandboxing', where they isolate a process from
the rest of the system and monitor for bad behavior before allowing it to
be run. Nettitude has an interesting write up on how [they broke out of
Avast's Sandbox](http://bit.ly/1SR4OWI).

PeerLyst goes over some lesser known options to unregister windows
functions actually allows you to [trigger remote code execution]
(http://bit.ly/1SBUoEY).

Or how about one hackers journey to claim a Facebook bug bounty led
them to [find a number of vulnerabilities in a product Facebook uses]
(http://bit.ly/1UifX1W)? Also found: Webshells from previous attackers.

Ars has [an interesting article on the 'Nuclear' Exploit Kit]
(http://bit.ly/1T5Q546). I found it interesting about how it uses user
agents to tailor payload and/or to evade detection.

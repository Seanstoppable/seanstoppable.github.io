Latest batch of interesting Security news.

Cloudflare has written an interesting article on the [Trouble With 
Tor](http://bit.ly/25z9hRj). 
Tor is an important tool for anonymity on the internet, but 94% of requests 
Cloudflare sees from Tor are malicious. Cloudflare offers an honest discussion 
regarding Tor, how they balance protecting their customers while still 
respecting the anonymity and usefulness Tor can provide, and how they are 
hoping to improve their methods to that end.

Did you know that the reference implementations of the next round of Crypto 
mechanisms come with large contributions from a single individual? One Peter 
Gutmann posts about [the Impending Crypto Monoculture](http://bit.ly/1RO852a).

LastLine Labs recently blogged about [a number of interesting malware 
trends](http://bit.ly/1SMF4XS): 
Code signing of malware is on a steady incline, malware is increasingly changing 
browser settings like setting a proxy to reroute traffic, malware that brute 
forces passwords is also increasing, and malware with evasion capabilities is 
pretty much the norm.

Locky continues to evolve since its introduction in February. CheckPoint has 
noticed that it is now [also being distributed via exploit 
kits](http://bit.ly/1Me9rr0), 
rather than exclusively via spam. Additionally, Locky has started making small 
changes to how it communicates with Command & Control (C2) servers, but enough 
to evade initial detection.

Fortinet has a report on the latest ransomware family. KimcilWare is a [new 
ransomware targeting Magento eCommerce sites](http://bit.ly/1quqQSk). 
In addition to encrypting files, it also acts as a backdoor. Fortinet has a 
great investigate writeup of how it works and backtracks it to the individual 
and group responsible.

Threatpost has an article on how [Firefox's extension framework does not isolate 
plugins](http://bit.ly/1qurGP5). This could allow for a plugin that doesn't look 
malicious as part of the validation process to actually leverage other plugins 
to do unintended things. Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge already sandbox 
extensions. Firefox plans to correct this problem later this year.

In ironic news, CNBC apparently [offered a password strength 
widget](http://bit.ly/1qslXK6) 
in order to educate readers on how strong their passwords were. Unfortunately, 
anyone who used it should change their password, as the form actually submitted 
the password to CNBC in plaintext, and probably forwarded it to third parties 
as well.

The BREACH, the compression side channel attack on HTTPs is back, with a [new 
variant dubbed Rupture](http://bit.ly/1REYzCZ>). 
The researchers produced their findings at Black Hat Asia last week and have 
demonstrated practical attacks to steal secrets from Facebook and Gmail chat 
sessions.

Mitre, manager of the CVE database has recently been criticized for the 
length of time it takes for a vulnerabilities to be reviewed and assigned a 
CVE have announced that they are [planning to decentralize the 
system](http://bit.ly/1WabRt7), 
citing the doubling of CVEs year over year (20k CVEs were issued in 2015 vs 10k 
in 2014). This plan has received some [criticism from the Open Source 
Vulnerability Database](http://bit.ly/1ozs8Kc) 
(which just announced they are shutting down), which points out facts such as 
Mitre falling behind other vulnerability databases by as many as 6k issues in 
2015 alone (indicating Mitre missed more than 23% of reported vulnerabilities) 
and Mitre refusing to create CVEs for products they don't monitor. 
[The Register also has some commentary](http://bit.ly/1TCK5Vl) 
which suggests the new proposed format will require rewrites of existing 
tools due to the proposed format change, which is not particularly desirable for 
a 'pilot project' that may be discarded.

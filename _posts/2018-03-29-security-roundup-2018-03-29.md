_Processor based attacks continue to be researched_. It should surprise no one
that security researchers have begun a close inspection of the hardware
platforms our software runs on. The latest one, called
[BranchPredictor](https://duo.com/decipher/branchscope-another-processor-based-attack),
appears to be a compliment of Spectre. Where Spectre leverages cached branch
predictions, BranchPredictor tries to prime branch prediction for exploitation.
Meanwhile, Microsoft's released a [bad patch for
Meltdown](https://threatpost.com/bad-microsoft-meltdown-patch-made-some-windows-systems-less-secure/130844/)
on Windows 7 machines allowing programs to read and write to arbitrary memory
locations (including what would otherwise be protected kernel memory).

_Your library account has expired_. That is the beginning of a highly effective
phishing hook that a set of hackers used for years [resulting in hacks into at
least 300
universities](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/iranian-hackers-charged-last-week-were-actually-pretty-damn-good-phishers/).
The phishing lures were so successful that the text rarely changed over the
course of four years, according to researchers into these campaigns.

_DNS over HTTPS promises security, bring privacy concerns_. DNS is one of the
primary protocols used on the internet. It was, however, not built with security
or privacy in mind, meaning that anyone able to monitor your traffic can what
servers a user is trying to contact. DNS over HTTPS (DoH) is a proposed solution
undergoing discussion at the IETF. In the wake of Facebook's privacy leaks,
privacy advocates worry that one level of privacy protection will enable
[more centralized points of
spying](https://threatpost.com/mozilla-tests-dns-over-https-meets-some-privacy-pushback/130765/).

_Invasive introspection of microcontroller firmware_. How far do you think one
is willing to take to reverse engineer programs on a hardware chip? Researchers
at Duo Security show you [just how far down the rabbit hole they have
gone](https://duo.com/blog/microcontroller-firmware-recovery-using-invasive-analysis).

_GoScanSSH targets multiple devices_. A new malware straing that has been active
since at least June 2017 has been discovered by TalosIntel. What is of interest
of this malware is its leveraging of Golang to [target multiple hardware
architectures](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/03/goscanssh-analysis.html).
The software itself uses an extensive list of 7K usernames and passwords to
break in, as well as a blacklist of IP blocks to try to avoid the scrutiny of
government actors.

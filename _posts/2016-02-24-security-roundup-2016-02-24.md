[Sara "Scout" Sinclair Brody](https://simplysecure.org/who-we-are/#scout), 
previous product manager at Google and Executive Director of the [new Simply 
Secure](https://simplysecure.org) organization has an interesting article on how 
security software should be [more usable for the average 
person](http://www.cfr.org/privacy/protecting-data-privacy-user-friendly-software/p37551).

Fraud! Ever interested about how [banks figure out whether activity is 
fraudulent](http://gizmodo.com/how-banks-use-machine-learning-to-know-a-crooks-using-y-1744771152)? 
Art forgery is fairly prevalent, and one scientist has come up with a method of 
['synthetic DNA authentication'](http://gizmodo.com/forgery-is-getting-so-good-that-scientists-had-to-inven-1736335563) 
where they hide unique one time codes in DNA.

Thanks to my co-worker Marcello for pointing out the severity of 
[CVE-2015-7547](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7547). 
Dan Kaminsky has a detailed explanation of why it is [bad to have a bug like 
this in such a low library](http://dankaminsky.com/2016/02/20/skeleton/), 
as so much that uses DNS is built on top of it.

The Linux Mint's server was hacked this week, [resulting in their distribution 
being backdoored](https://thehackernews.com/2016/02/linux-mint-hack.html) 
before the maintainers shut things down. The hacker responsible [apparently 
did an interview](http://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-hundreds-were-tricked-into-installing-linux-mint-backdoor/), 
indicating they were hoping to build a botnet.

As a consumer of threat intelligence, I find Netflix's [FIDO Automatic Security 
Incident Response system](http://techblog.netflix.com/2015/05/introducing-fido-automated-security.html) 
super interesting.

Comodo, the 'leading Internet Security Provider', has been found to not only 
have [disabled some security protections in their custom 
browser](https://threatpost.com/chromodo-browser-disables-same-origin-policy/116131/), 
but more recently been found to [bundle a VNC server with a discoverable 
password](https://threatpost.com/chromodo-browser-disables-same-origin-policy/116131/).

There is a new ransomware package on the loose named Locky. Here is a detailed 
breakdown on the [phishing, social engineering, and technical 
steps](http://blog.continuum.net/new-locky-ransomware-faqs-and-how-msps-can-act-now) 
that it takes to take over your system.

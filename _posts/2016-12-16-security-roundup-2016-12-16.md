End of the year is quickly approaching, and a number of groups are starting
predictions for the new year, including:

* Checkpoint has some [cloud
  predictions](http://blog.checkpoint.com/2016/12/14/cloud-security-predictions-and-trends/)
  including ransomware ending up in a data centre (vs user machines) and a major
  attack on a cloud provider.
* Ensilo has a number of predictions, many business related, but a few others
  including [javascript replacing
  flash](http://blog.ensilo.com/predictions-2017-goodbye-flash.-hello-jscript)
  as the number one cause of browser exploits, security [moving down the
  stack](http://blog.ensilo.com/predictions-2017-security-moves-down-the-stack)
  to have more protections at a hardware level, and ransomware moving to 'spray
  and pray' to [more targeted
  attacks](http://blog.ensilo.com/predictions-2017-targeted-ransomware).
* Malwarebytes unsurprisingly predicts that [Ransomware will continue to be king
  in
  2017](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2016/12/security-in-2017-ransomware-will-remain-king/),
  with high risk items like digital wallets and password managers becoming
  targets.

Rapid 7 has an insightful (to me at least) article on [Why Security Assessments
are Often not a True Reflection of
Reality](https://community.rapid7.com/community/infosec/blog/2016/12/08/why-security-assessments-are-often-not-a-true-reflection-of-reality),
and how the scoping of security assessments can lead to a lot of caveats.

Checkpoint Labs put out their [November Malware Most
Wanted](http://blog.checkpoint.com/2016/12/13/ransomware-attacks-spike-globally-novembers-wanted-malware-list/).
Locky doesn't quite top the list, but did manage to be the #1 malware family in
34 countries, while Conficker (still at the top) was only #1 in 28.

NakedSecurity has an end of year article around the [number of records lost in
breaches](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/12/14/news-in-brief-uber-goes-driverless-in-sfo-skype-on-macos-2016s-breaches-tallied-encryption-call-for-cameras/),
totally 2.14 BILLION records, up from 480m records last year. Unfortunately,
these numbers were reported before [Yahoo indicated another breach of 1 billion
records](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/12/yahoo-one-billion-more-accounts-hacked/),
a separate incident from the one reported this year.

Poor Yahoo, on top of all the bad news this year, they recently patched an [XSS
bug which would have allowed attackers the ability to read a user's
email](https://threatpost.com/yahoo-mail-xss-bug-worth-another-10k-to-researcher/122376/).

BleepingComputer rounds up with
[Ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-december-9th-2016-osiris-pornopoker-popcorn-time-locked-in-and-more/).
Last week included: new variants, a botnet spreading ransomware that had a
decryptor released in the summer (oops), a ransomware that will decrypt your
files if you infect your friends (social!), and a new open source Ransomware
that has already spawned at least 3 variants in the wild.

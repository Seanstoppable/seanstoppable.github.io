_RouterSploit 3.0 Released_. A security tool for auditing routers has [gotten a
major upgrade](https://www.threat9.com/blog.html). The biggest new feature tries
to address the plague of default credentials, but providing a framework for
anyone to add the appropriate authentication method for devices. This seems
pretty important area of research, given stories like:
  * [This tweet](https://twitter.com/cbekrar/status/993507425801068544) suggesting that
  Zerodium has paid out bounties for exploits for every major router. 
  * [Patches for critical vulnerabilities](https://threatpost.com/sierra-wireless-patches-critical-vulns-in-hundreds-of-thousands-of-wireless-routers/131804/)
  in Sierra Wireless devices.
  * Router malware that [survives
  reboots](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hide-and-seek-becomes-first-iot-botnet-capable-of-surviving-device-reboots/).
  * Another set of exploits for GPON routers [impacting millions of
  devices](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/vulnerabilities-affecting-over-one-million-dasan-gpon-routers-are-now-under-attack/).

_Other internet connected device flaws_. Routers are not the only devices with
reported flaws this week:
  * This DVR exploit that is so simple [the exploit fits into a
  tweet](https://boingboing.net/2018/05/08/morzilla.html).
  * More flaws discovered in [SCADA
  devices](https://gizmodo.com/critical-flaws-in-industrial-software-left-us-infrastru-1825699778).
  * The Harmony Hub has several flaws discovered, including being able to [turn
  on a dormant SSH
  server](https://threatpost.com/bugs-in-logitech-harmony-hub-put-connected-iot-devices-at-high-risk/131776/)
  to gain remote control.

_Office 365 Zero day discovered_. Overlooked html functionality has resulted in
an Office 365 zero day which [bypasses security
checks](https://www.avanan.com/resources/basestriker-vulnerability-office-365).

_Fun with passwords_. Who better to get password tips than from those that break
them? Rapid7 has collected passwords from a number of security engagements and
[has some tips on how people can do
better](https://blog.rapid7.com/2018/05/10/password-tips-from-a-pen-tester-3-passwords-to-eliminate/).
Troy Hunt also reminds us all that password selection is horrible, with more
than 86% of passwords in a recent breach [already appearing in other
breaches](https://www.troyhunt.com/86-of-passwords-are-terrible-and-other-statistics/)
making brute force attempts that much easier.

_Hijacked Accounts on Steam_. Finally frustrated by scammers on the online
gaming community Steam, one security researchers set out to [discover how they
worked](https://samcurry.net/hacking-a-massive-steam-scamming-and-phishing-operation-for-fun-and-profit/),
leading to him finding their admin console and alerting Steam of compromised
user accounts.

_OS Makers misread docs, build in vulnerabilities_. The majority of OS providers
are releasing patches this week to deal with a misunderstanding on how Intel
deals with [debug
exceptions](https://threatpost.com/major-os-players-misinterpret-intel-docs-and-now-kernels-can-be-hijacked/131869/)
due to ambiguous documentation. This could allow an attacker with physical
access to a machine to get elevated privileges.

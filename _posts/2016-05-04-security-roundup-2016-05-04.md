One engineer recently found 'Shellshock' style user agent strings in his 
log files. After investigation, he realized that an attacker was [using
someone's unsecured log files as a blind drop for scanning results](http://bit.ly/1WEeiE5).

Apparently, a few years ago, someone set up a project to try and find 
common factors in RSA PGP keys. Last year, [they started processing keys 
from the public keyserver dataset](http://bit.ly/1W4xqMv). To date, they have 
found over 200 broken keys and 2000 keys with suspicious characteristics, 
[including keys from Apple, Product Security, Nasa, and The Pirate Party](http://bit.ly/1SKOYrn). 
These keys contain things like non-prime factors and shared factors, where 
if you take 2 keys with one known shared factor, you can figure out the 
second (and thus generate a private key). This could either be due to 
[poor sources of entropy or deliberately crippled PGP implementations](http://bit.ly/1SZcCFM).

The Verge has a good article on [why fingerprints are not good for
authentication](http://bit.ly/1VIfl6Z). Among other things: The government
has a giant database of fingerprints (mine have been scanned when traveling
back and forth from Canada), and thus are leak-able. Unlike passwords,
changing fingerprints (and other biometrics) is pretty hard and we leave
our fingerprints everywhere. If anything, biometrics are more akin to a
username then they are to a password.

Some security researchers recently realized that Slack API tokens were
checked in to Github repositories. They quickly realized [they could gain
access to a lot of sensitive information, including passwords]
(http://bit.ly/1OeFaUz). Slack has indicated they are now scanning Github
and revoking found tokens, similar to what other services like Amazon
currently do.

In a follow up on the recent story of how quickly people plug in random USB
keys, Infosecurity Magazine has an article on how the American Dental
Association [accidentally spread malware via USB keys they had manufactured]
(http://bit.ly/24vunhZ).

After 100 breaches, Have I Been Pwned has [had breach data submitted by the
breached company, rather than finding the data online]
(http://bit.ly/21ud67f). A similar service, Pwnedlist, has recently had [a
major security vulnerability communicated to them](http://bit.ly/1VIZSUp),
and has decided to shut down their public site.

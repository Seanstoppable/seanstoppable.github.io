_Backdooring Encryption_. An industry veteran claims they have solved how to
['safely' backdoor
cryptography](https://www.wired.com/story/crypto-war-clear-encryption). The
solution is effectively key escrow. But, as a number of experts, such as
[Matthew
Green](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/04/26/a-few-thoughts-on-ray-ozzies-clear-proposal/)
are pointing out, Key escrow is going to make that key storage a big target.
Especially given either: a) every organization will have to create their own
implementation or b) Someone will mandate a centralize repo, ripe for
exploitation and/or abuse. Also, that a lot of phones are manufactured overseas,
what happens when a foreign government coerces the manufacturer to provide
access to all the escrowed keys?

_Alexa, record everything_. Security researchers figured out a way to
make an Alexa skill [record all
audio](https://gizmodo.com/security-researchers-created-a-skill-that-allows-alexa-1825549349)
after a user activates their task.

_RFID Lock Insecurities_. When was the last time you were at a hotel that DIDN'T
have an RFID or a magstripe lock? A+ for convenience, but a number of these
locks have vulnerabilties, as security researchers prove they can [break into a
number of RFID
locks](https://www.wired.com/story/one-minute-attack-let-hackers-spoof-hotel-master-keys/)
with ~$300 worth of materials, an expired keycard, and about a minute of time.

_Fun with Honeypots_. A [2018
look](https://medium.com/@dmrickert/what-ssh-hacking-attempts-look-like-8f698e70a4f5)
at what happens when you set up an SSH honeypot. No surprise that there is a lot
of IoT type guesses. 

_Share passwords..._. Be careful using 'sharing cultute' SaaS apps. You may, for
example, end up [sharing
passwords](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/05/when-your-employees-post-passwords-online/)
or confidential information with the public, as some Trello users accidentally
did.

_... or log passwords!_. Both
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/992132808192634881) and
[Github](https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-says-bug-exposed-account-passwords/)
announced they found subsystems that accidentally logged passwords.
While no indication that someone obtained these logs, make sure to change
passwords anyway.

_Supply chain attacks in npm libs_. A crafted backdoor was found in an npm
package. While this npm package was not itself popular, the attackers actually
got it [merged in to an older, but still used, software
package](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/somebody-tried-to-hide-a-backdoor-in-a-popular-javascript-npm-package/).
The package would have allowed remote code execution, and could have been
included in project just by a developer updating all packages. The impacted npm
libraries have now been removed.

_Massminer_. Finally, for those that love stories of malware, check out
[Massminer](https://www.alienvault.com/blogs/labs-research/massminer-malware-targeting-web-servers)
the latest in cryptocurrency malicious miners. What seperated Massminer apart is
its inclusion of masscan, a tool for scanning for open ports, which it then
leverages to find targets for a number of popular exploits.

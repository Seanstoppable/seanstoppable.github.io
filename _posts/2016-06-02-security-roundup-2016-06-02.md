LinkedIn is apparently not the only service to have a large number of user 
accounts come to light this month. MySpace (breach between 2007 to 2010), 
Tumblr (2013), and Fling (2011) are all data sets that have apparently been 
lying dormants, but [add up to 642 million user accounts](http://bit.ly/1VA6OT3). 
Troy Hunt of Have I Been Pwned has indicated these 4 breaches are in the 
[top 5 of the 109 breaches he has recorded to date](http://bit.ly/1Xm7Rrs). 

World renowned password cracker Jeremi M Gosney has an article on ["How 
LinkedIn's password sloppiness hurts us all"](http://bit.ly/1TMbrVt). 
He has worked with teams to crack 98% of the LinkedIn password data and they 
managed to do so in 6 days. End result is a large corpus of actual user password 
data which can be used as a wordlist, to analyze to create newer/better fuzzing 
rules, and overall makes slow-hashing functions like BCrypt and Argon2 less 
effective since password crackers will potentially require less attempts to 
break into accounts.

Microsoft, meanwhile, has announced an initiative to [better protect user 
passwords](http://bit.ly/1Uk7Yg8). One layer actively bans bad passwords, which 
Microsoft collects more and more data on based on attacks. Another layer 
actively locks out accounts with attempts meeting a certain criteria and 
actively notifies an account holder. These features are being rolled out to 
Azure AD in a limited beta.

In terms of randomness, TOR goes to great lengths to generate enough randomness 
to encrypt all communications across its network. Naked Security has an article 
on how Tor generates randomness such that [poisoned nodes don't undermine the 
network as a whole](http://bit.ly/20WaZbp).

For those procuring workstations for their employees, be sure to read this Duo 
article on [OEM Updater Security](http://duo.sc/1sQedlt). Duo managed to find 
vulnerabilities in all OEM Updater software that would allow them to execute 
arbitrary commands as a system user. While some attempts were made to harden 
updaters, more often than not some basic security measures (TLS communication, 
update validation, manifest validation) were not done.

The Internet Crime Complaint Centre has [published their 2015 
report](https://pdf.ic3.gov/2015_IC3Report.pdf). 
Highlights include: wire transfer fraud via phishing attacks have losses of over 
$263 million reported, corporate data breaches resulted in ~$39 million in 
losses, and malware compromised ~$5 million in losses with ransomware breaking 
the 1 million mark with ~$1.6 million in losses.

Checkpoint has an updated [write up of CryptXXX](http://bit.ly/1PoLcYo). 
Evolving out of TeslaCrypt, CryptXXX seems to be serving their code as a DLL, 
and then using Windows binaries to execute the code at some later time. Since 
there is no base executable, this evades many sandboxes. CryptXXX takes this one 
step further by delaying execution, to further thwart any sandboxing.

This week I learned about some implementations of TLS have apparently failed to 
respect nonce uniqueness when setting up connections, thus opening the 
opportunity for forgery attacks against HTTPS sites. Unfortunately, some 
[VISA sites have been discovered to have this issue](http://bit.ly/24lrsGX).

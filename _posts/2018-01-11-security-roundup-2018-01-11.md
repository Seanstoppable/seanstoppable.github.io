_Processors continue to receive security scrutiny_. On the heels of Meltdown and
Spectre, another CPU related security [vulnerability in AMD's Trusted Platform
Module](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/security-flaw-in-amds-secure-chip-on-chip-processor-disclosed-online/)
in their Secure Processor. The vulnerability would allow a crafty attacker to
be able to execute code inside the processor, potentially accessing any secrets
contained therein. This is similar to a vulnerability discovered last year in
Intel's [Management
Engine](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/intel-fixes-critical-bugs-in-management-engine-its-secret-cpu-on-chip/),
which is also intended to manage secrets. Given the recent discoveries, expect
security researchers to continue shining lights on the hardware that we use
every day.

_Vulnerability Rediscovery_. Did you know that 4 separate researchers
independently discovered Spectre and Meltdown? It is a [remarkable story of
convergence](https://www.wired.com/story/meltdown-spectre-bug-collision-intel-chip-flaw-discovery/),
and security researcher Bruce Schnier even wrote a paper on ['Taking Stock:
Estimating Vulnerability
Rediscovery'](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2928758) last
year. The question some researchers are asking is, if they all discovered it
around the same time, how likely is it that someone else found it earlier and
didn't disclose it?

_Github to expand security monitoring_. Github has acquired the people behind
[Appcanary](https://appcanary.com/), a service that monitors software
dependencies and server packages for vulnerabilities. At Github, they will be
working on expanding Github's security tooling, like their [vulnerability
management
program](https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/04/appcanary-shuts-down-its-vulnerability-scanning-service-as-the-team-joins-github/).

_The breaches that did not happen in 2017_. In a more positive outlook,
HackerOne [reviews bug bounty programs in
2017](https://www.hackerone.com/blog/Data-Breaches-Did-Not-Happen-2017),
pointing out that tens of thousands of security vulnerabilities were identified
and remediated using these programs.

_I'm Harvesting Sensitive Information From Your Site_. While people freak out
about hardware level vulnerabilities, others theorize about how to actually
steal sensitive information, such as this somewhat sarcastic take on [how to
steal sensitive information from
sites](https://hackernoon.com/im-harvesting-credit-card-numbers-and-passwords-from-your-site-here-s-how-9a8cb347c5b5). 
Involving creating a helpful library with some obfuscated malicious code, and
then selectively sending data back to a server. How many organizations would
actually detect this? Given similar types of attacks via [Chrome plugins](), or
[Wordpress plugins](), an attack like this actually could realistically live for
a long time.

_Extended Validation Collisions_. Extended validation for SSL Certs, the process
by which you certify you are a valid organization, and get some additional stuff
for your certificate apparently has a problem in [Organizational
Collisions](https://stripe.ian.sh/). The security researcher even went through
the process of setting up a corporation to leverage this, suggesting that this
may be possible for the low, low price of $177 dollars.

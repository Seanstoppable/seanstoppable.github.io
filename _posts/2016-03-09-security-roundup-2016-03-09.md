Big batch of interesting things this week.

Enjoy!

Checkpoint has a nice article on ['Why Visibility Is Critical To Your Security Management Program](http://bit.ly/1OZioib), where I feel there are a lot of overlaps on 'Why Visibility Is Critical To Your Third Party Risk Management Program'.

Google just open sourced their [Vendor Security Assessment Questionnaire](http://bit.ly/1URl2hs) system, which they use to automate their vendor survey process of hundreds of vendors each year.

For those interested in a VPN, one reddit user has compiled a [giant list of datapoints on over 100 VPN services](http://bit.ly/1QCb6VZ).

High Scalability has an article on [backdoors and code reviews](http://bit.ly/1Ykhu72).

Use your fingerprint to unlock your smartphone? You might want to [watch this video](http://bit.ly/1OZOKJL).

My co-worker Bennet has pointed out that Akamai has released their [Q4 State of the Internet report](http://akamai.me/1OZOkD1), detailing the attacks they are seeing on their customers. Overall DDOS was up 150% YoY. Application level attacks increased 28% QoQ, with 59% of application level attacks targeted retailers.

Following up on the [previous Locky news](http://bit.ly/1TJJr9C), Checkpoint has some [more information](http://bit.ly/21kp8yb), including volume (100K attempts on their clients in 2 weeks), data collection analysis, server identification and some DGA analysis.

Because it is tax season, phishing scams are going after W-2 forms. And unfortunately companies are [forking them out by the thousands](http://bit.ly/1U2N1eo), including Seagate.

Wordpress powers tens of millions of websites, and hacking them is big business. Recently, Sucuri noticed that popular, but largely abandoned plugins have been [taken over to inject vulnerabilities](http://bit.ly/1QADqcu). Of course, not upgrading plugins means you are open to being attacked by old vulnerabilities like [this old RevSlider vulnerability](http://bit.ly/1OX3okY). Google dorking is being used to find this vulnerability, and the culprit is leveraging Google's large number of TLDs to get around the captcha search limits.

'Vault7' coverage continues this week:

WikiLeaks has apparently decided to follow 'responsible disclosure' and give
access to exploits to the [companies that have vulnerable
products](https://boingboing.net/2017/03/10/no-security-in-obscurity.html),
allowing them time to create appropriate patches.

McAfee has apparently already [written a
scanner](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/business/chipsec-support-vault-7-disclosure-scanning/)
to check for compromised EFI Firmware, based on comments made in the Vault7 data
set.

Notepad++ has quickly moved to [check the certificates of DLLs it
uses](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/notepad-7.3.3-fix-cia-hacking-issue.html),
that were described in Vault7 documentation. The [Reddit
Community](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/5yym2n/notepad_we_are_in_a_fking_corrupted_world/)
discusses whether this will actually make a difference.

In other news:

More news on last year's Yahoo breach announcements: the FBI believes it is
likely that initial access was gained by a [speak phishing
attack](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/03/fbi-hints-that-hack-of-semi-privileged-yahoo-employee-led-to-massive-breach/)
on a somewhat privileged user, allowing attackers to discover and then
exfiltrate a program that allowed some Yahoo employees to generate
authentication cookies to access user's accounts.

Some scanning of 'official' docker repositories in Docker Hub indicate that [a
large number of said images have major
vulnerabilities](https://www.federacy.com/docker_image_vulnerabilities). Almost
11% have high priority vulnerabilities present in the container, and the scan
only covered ~68% of the 'official' repos, and doesn't cover a subset of
operating systems (due to them not being supported with the scanning tool).
While this doesn't make the containers directly vulnerable, it certainly leaves
bigger attack surfaces. Docker Hub, at least, provides indicators on their site
that said containers contain a set of vulnerabilities.

In similar news, researchers have done analysis of a number of websites and
found that [37% of them have outdated and vulnerable
libraries](http://www.zdnet.com/article/an-insecure-mess-how-flawed-javascript-is-turning-web-into-a-hackers-playground/),
with many being popular libraries like jQuery and Angular.

Two new bug bounties have
[been announces](https://threatpost.com/intel-microsoft-announce-new-bug-bounties/124354/), 
where Intel has opened one that covers software and hardware, while Microsoft
has launched one that provides access to Microsoft Office Insider Builds,
allowing researchers to find vulnerabilities before new releases.

1Password has set up a very specific bug challenge called 'bad poetry', which is
eligible for a whopping [$100k
bounty](https://lifehacker.com/remains-of-the-day-1password-offers-up-100k-bug-bount-1793170735).
The details of this are, unfortunately, invite only.

One developer writes of [how awful our password policies
are](https://blog.codinghorror.com/password-rules-are-bullshit/) and lists
several observations made when building a new auth system. Length is the primary
item he points out, where extending minimum password length to 10 characters
makes 80% of the most common passwords in use today invalid.

Checkpoint discloses vulnerabilities discovered in both Telegram and
Whatsapp which would have allowed malicious attackers to take over accounts by
sending a user a [malicious file that looks like an
image](http://blog.checkpoint.com/2017/03/15/check-point-discloses-vulnerability-whatsapp-telegram/).

Checkpoint has also released their newest [Malware 'Most
Wanted'](http://blog.checkpoint.com/2017/03/13/check-point-february-top-malware/).
Biggest shift is the malware strain
[Hanticor](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/HancitorPonyVawtrak+malspam/21919),
which has climbed 22 places to rank #5 on the list. 

More IoT devices are under siege as a number of Dahua and Hikvision IoT
Devices have [been attacked with accessible
credentials](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/03/dahua-hikvision-iot-devices-under-siege/). 

Google goes into how they detected, and shut down, the [Chamois Android
botnet](https://security.googleblog.com/2017/03/detecting-and-eliminating-chamois-fraud.html),
beginning from ad traffic analysis and ending with their Verify Apps program
allowing users to be notified and remove.

Threatpost declares a [decline in browser exploit
kits](https://threatpost.com/where-have-all-the-exploit-kits-gone/124241/),
citing both stronger defenses as browsers improve their own security as well as
some recent arrests causing groups to shut down operations.

For those who like reading up on the internals of malware, MalwareBytes has a
good [writeup of the Spora
ransomware](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2017/03/spora-ransomware/).

BleepingComputer [covers
RanRan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-ranran-ransomware-uses-encryption-tiers-political-messages/),
a ransomware that asked users to create a subdomain for decryption, as well as
provided several 'tiers' (based on file size), to encrypt files.

Ever heard the story where an attacker can compromise a site just by leaving 
some USB keys around? Elie decided to put these to the test and found that 
[48% of users will plug in a drive and open a file](http://bit.ly/1YsqeHV). 
20% of the drives were connected in the first hour, the first being connected 
and a file opened within 6 minutes of the experiment starting.

Who phishes the phishers? PhishMe posts about [a CEO wire transfer fraud attack 
directed at them](http://bit.ly/1oVrI10), 
and how they decided to deal with it. Phishing a phishing defense company? 
Probably not the greatest idea.

Google just published a paper on their 'trust 
nothing' policy, where trust nothing means also not trusting internal networks. 
This means that attackers that make it past the perimeter still have to deal 
with a hard, crunchy interior. 
[The Registry has a nice summary](http://bit.ly/22sHmOL).

An interesting article on how [Bitcoin is not entirely 
anonymous](http://bit.ly/1NnhmND). 
By monitoring the entire blockchain and grouping transactions together, you can 
actually figure out what services an individual is using, which could lead to 
services being able to refuse funds from users based on activity.

Talos Intel provides an informative write up of the ['Past, Present and Future 
of Ransomware'](http://bit.ly/1Yui15Q). 
The future? Moving from phishing payloads to becoming worms targeting internal 
vulnerabilities and/or other malware to propagate through networks. Checkpoint 
has an interesting perspective where they view Ransomware as increasing 
rapidly, with the [previously lucrative banking trojans on a decline](http://bit.ly/1qSAj6u). 
Ransomware is proving to be much simpler to develop vs banking trojans which 
have to be customized for specific banks, thus allowing them to reach a larger 
audience of victims.

Locky, unsurprisingly, [continues to evolve](http://bit.ly/1Wstgxh). 
Newest changes include a more robust Domain Name Generation (DGA) algorithm to 
avoid detection of outbound communications, saving data in random registry 
keys to avoid detection, and additional code obfuscation.

Several high profile sites, such as the New York Times and the BBC have been 
impacted by Malvertising. A classic third party attack where bad actors use ad 
networks to inject hostile payloads into sites. Checkpoint has a 
[brief history](http://bit.ly/23FVBSB).

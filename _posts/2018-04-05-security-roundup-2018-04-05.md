_Panera bread data leak_. The big news this week was Panera's treatment of a
security disclosure, where they did not address a [security flaw that exposed
user
information](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/04/panera-accused-security-researcher-of-scam-when-he-reported-a-major-flaw/)
for 8 months. Panera was driven to take action only after the security
researcher reached out to Brian Krebs, who published [a scathing
article](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/04/panerabread-com-leaks-millions-of-customer-records/)
of the details. You can read the researcher's story
[here](https://medium.com/@djhoulihan/no-panera-bread-doesnt-take-security-seriously-bf078027f815).

_Honeypot meat HoneyBot_. In an ever increasingly connected world, there is
increased concern about security surrounding connected devices, including
robots. Now, one set of researchers have started experimenting with
[HoneyBots](https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/29/honeybot-lures-hackers-protect-fellow-robots/),
taking the concept of a honeypot where researchers observe malicious users and
applying the same concept to robots.

_Chat Widgets leak PII_. Security researchers discovered a number of live chat
systems, used by companies including Google, Verizon and Disney, were [leaking
actual employee
names](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/live-chat-widgets-leak-employee-details-from-high-profile-companies/)
and other identifying details. This could lead to tailored social engineering
attacks, or even directed harrasment of employees.

_Obfuscation through legitimate appearances_. Analysts at Sucuri had fun
analyzing what at first glance may look like an innocent file with proper code
structure, but turned out to be [obfuscated wordpress
malware](https://blog.sucuri.net/2018/04/obfuscation-through-legitimate-appearances.html).

_Privacy in DNS_. While the push for TLS to provide secure communications
continues, others have decided to look at other points of internet privacy. Now,
while communications over TLS may be unknowable, someone still knows who you are
calling due to DNS. There are now numerous researchers looking at this problem,
from OpenDNS who has run
[DNSCrypt](https://www.opendns.com/about/innovations/dnscrypt/) for several
years, Cloudflare who is pushing DNS over TLS and [just launched a new
resolver](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/1/17185732/cloudflare-dns-service-1-1-1-1),
and even academic researchers in Princeton who are working on [Oblivious
DNS](https://odns.cs.princeton.edu/).

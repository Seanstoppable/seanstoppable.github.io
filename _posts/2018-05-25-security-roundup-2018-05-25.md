_VPNFilter_. Talos Intel has decided preliminary research on
[VPNFilter](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/05/VPNFilter.html), due to
active exploit in the Ukraine. This malware strain appears to be installed on
networking devices across the globe, and has device destructive capabilities. It
is also installed on half a million devices, which would have a large impact if
triggered. 

_More IoT Failure_. In related news, vulnerabilities have been found in some
[D-Link
routers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/backdoor-account-found-in-d-link-dir-620-routers/).
Additionally, Comcast just fixed a bug in some routers that [may accidentally
leak wifi
passwords](https://threatpost.com/comcast-patches-router-bug-that-leaked-some-wi-fi-passwords/132183/).

_Vigilant Observation_. An ESET researcher discovered two [zero days in the
making](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shadowy-hackers-accidentally-reveal-two-zero-days-to-security-researchers/)
after reverse engineering samples that attackers had uploaded to virus scanning
engines to test their detectability.

_Living in a post-Drupalgeddon world_. Two major Drupal vulnerabilities dropped
last week, and now MalwareBytes serves up a look at [how Drupal in the wild now
looks](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2018/05/look-drupalgeddon-client-side-attacks/).
Expect unpatched instances, and those instances having been exploited.

_Business model for botnets_. After all, the goal if to make money. But [how
much?](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611123/inside-the-business-model-for-botnets/).

_More Spectre Like Flaws_. Another processor side channel attack was announced
on Monday and, with increased scrutiny, researchers [expect to announce more in
the
future](https://threatpost.com/researchers-say-more-spectre-related-cpu-flaws-on-horizon/132199/).

_New way to abuse cryotominers_. Cryptominers have been abusing client's
resources for months, and now a new abuse has been found - [URL
Shorteners](https://blog.sucuri.net/2018/05/cryptomining-through-disguised-url-shorteners.html).
Specifically, Coinhive has been experimenting with a URL shortener that forwards
users after they have solved a number of hashes, which some are abusing by
embedding in iFrames in other sites to have the cryptominer run as long as the
page is loaded.

_Botnet Persistence_. According to some recent research, 58% of botnet
infections [only last a
day](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/58-percent-of-botnet-malware-infections-last-under-a-day/).

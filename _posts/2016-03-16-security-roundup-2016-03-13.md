In an amusing example of 'trust but verify', there is a story of [data collection UIs not sanitizing input](http://bit.ly/1RjaBxb) when displaying to users.

Last year Google Research apparently published ["Secrets, Lies, and Account Recovery: Lessons from the Use of Personal Knowledge Questions at Google"](http://bit.ly/1XrKybO>), and I have discovered a [quick summary of the paper](http://bit.ly/1UuN5md). Summary of the summary: online guessing attacks can be fairly effective and cheap.

Security company Staminus Communications [was hacked last week](http://bit.ly/1SOAcng). Hackers dumped the data and started with a list of "TIPS WHEN RUNNING A SECURITY COMPANY"

After last week's mention that Google open sourced their vendor survey system, my co-worker Bennet pointed out that Facebook has a program called 'Facebook for Work' and they are [considering how to do vendor risk assessment](http://on.wsj.com/1Z1VtKL).

Interested in hacking your vehicle? BoingBoing has a short review of the new edition of [The Car Hacker's Handbook](http://bit.ly/1S0Z4FZ).

For those who love dashboards, I just discovered the [Kaspersky Cyberstat](http://bit.ly/1UuPgX2) board.

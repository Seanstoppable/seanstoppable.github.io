Big news this week is Symantec's miss-issue of 30K Extended Validation
certificates, largely through [third parties with privileged
access](http://www.csoonline.com/article/3184897/security/api-flaws-said-to-have-left-symantec-ssl-certificates-vulnerable-to-compromise.html). 
Extended Validation certificates are intended to require
additional validation steps for further proof of ownership, and the lack of that
compromises their advantage. This isn't the first time that Symantec has
mis-issued certificates, with Google recently requiring Symantec to submit ALL
certificates to Certificate Transparency logs for auditing. After the most
recent incident, however, Google has declared they will [stop treating Symantec
Extended Validation certificates as extended
validation](https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/03/google-takes-symantec-to-the-woodshed-for-mis-issuing-30000-https-certs/).
Further, Google has [suggested
plans](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/blink-dev/eUAKwjihhBs/rpxMXjZHCQAJ)
to stop trusting Symantec as an SSL certificate provider, phasing out support 
in Chrome to essentially delist said certificates.
Symantec has [posted a
rebuttal](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/symantec-backs-its-ca),
pointing out their usage of certificate transparency, and their championing of
Certificate Authority Authorization. Regardless of the outcome, it appears that
the end result will be more transparency and security for the internet as a
whole.

Let's Encrypt came under attack of actually providing transparency this week,
since it points out that they have issues quite a number of [SSL Certificates
which could be used for phishing
attacks](https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/lets-encrypt-phishing/), having issues
~15k certificates using the term 'Paypal' this quarter. Let's Encrypt has
pointed out since inception their belief that [Certificate Authorities
constitute poor
watchdogs](https://letsencrypt.org/2015/10/29/phishing-and-malware.html), with
their primary aim to encrypt all web communications. Bleeping Computer points
out that a number of these certificates have been [flagged by safe
browsing](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/14-766-lets-encrypt-ssl-certificates-issued-to-paypal-phishing-sites/),
which does indicate that other user protections are in play. While on the one
hand these certificates are being issues, the fact that they are going through
certificate transparency and being on the record is at least shedding more light 
on the issue.

Congress has voted to repeal FCC Privacy laws, but right before that the EFF
posted some [impacts of
CyberSecurity](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/five-ways-cybersecurity-will-suffer-if-congress-repeals-fcc-privacy-rules). 
Particularly worrying to me is the concept of "Explicit Trusted Proxies", which
are designed to decrypt and inspect SSL communications, which we learned last
week that the the US-CERT has said doing this type of traffic interception
actually decreases overall security.

In further Vault7 news, Engadget has a [list of tool names and
descriptions](https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/09/names-and-definitions-of-leaked-cia-hacking-tools),
as well as an article explicitly on [OSX
exploits](https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/23/wikileaks-releases-new-cia-documents-describing-mac-exploits). 
Apple has already said that these exploits are old, and have been fixed.

After yet [another round of breaches](https://twitter.com/haveibeenpwned/), 
Troy Hunt has written an article on [How To Handle a Breach
Disclosure](https://www.troyhunt.com/data-breach-disclosure-101-how-to-succeed-after-youve-failed/).
Using Cloudpets as example, Troy points out that someone noticed their exposed
Mongo database and attempted to contact them to remediate before the breach
occurred. Troy points out that making it harder for someone to start a dialogue
makes it easier for a company to be unaware of action in need of taking. He goes
on to point out that once a breach is known, it is in the company's best
interest to disclose as soon as possible, to allow their users time to protect
themselves, pointing out the rampant reuse of user passwords. He references the
upcoming [General Data Protection
Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) in
Europe, where companies will be required to disclose breaches within 72 hours.
The entire article is fairly interesting, containing a number of breach
disclosure successes, as well as quite a few failures.

Many malware strains are starting to make use of a technique called [Domain
Fronting](https://threatpost.com/apt29-used-domain-fronting-tor-to-execute-backdoor/124582/).
This technique works by using a hosting provider essentially as a relay to some
other communication like TOR. These providers include Amazon and Google's
Appspot in order to avoid block evasion/delisting.

For those that enjoy reading up on malware detection evasion Talos Intel [shares
some recent obfuscation methods by
LokiBot](http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/03/how-malformed-rtf-defeats-security.html).

Talos also details an [NTP
vulnerability](http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/03/ntpd-dos.html) they
discovered in Cisco's effort to test NTP implementations for security flaws.

Finally, BleepingComputer talks about
[GiftGhostBot](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/almost-1-000-online-stores-under-attack-from-giftghostbot-botnet/),
a botnet devoted to brute forcing gift card apis to discover gift cards with
usable funds. On average, this botnet is apparently hitting some eCommerce sites
with an average of 1.7 million requests per hour.

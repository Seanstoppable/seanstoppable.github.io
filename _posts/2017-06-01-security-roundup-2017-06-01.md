Let's start with a Samba exploit roundup:

 * With Microsoft releasing a patch for Windows XP, people (including myself)
   were quick to blame it for the spread of WannaCry. However, it was actually
   [Windows 7 that was the most
   infected](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/05/25/wannacry-the-rush-to-blame-xp-masked-bigger-problems/).
   Windows 7 still is end of life, meaning that the only extended support
   customers are likely to have gotten the initial security patch.
 * The EternalRocks author has thrown in the towel after [being scared
   off](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/author-of-eternalrocks-smb-worm-calls-it-quits-after-intense-media-coverage/)
   by last weeks's news coverage.
 * Hardware providers are rolling out patches for impacted devices, [check your
   device](https://threatpost.com/cisco-netgear-readying-patches-for-samba-vulnerability/125974/)
   for updates today!

The ShadowBrokers have [announced
details](https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/05/new-shadow-brokers-0day-subscription-forces-high-risk-gamble-on-whitehats/)
of their monthly exploit dumps. For 100 Zcash, a privacy oriented
cryptocurrency (which is equivalant to ~$26K USD at time of writing), will get
anyone access to an unknown slate of exploits. Security experts are torn between
not wanting to pay for exploits, and wanting to avoid another WannaCry
situation. One group of individuals has taken to crowdfunding to gain access, 
promising to alert companies of zero days and then releasing the data publicly 
for additional scrutiny. It has since been cancelled [due to legal
concerns](https://threatpost.com/crowdfunding-effort-to-buy-shadowbrokers-exploits-shuts-down/126010/)
over purchasing explicit exploits. 

Another Windows XP and Windows 2004 security patch has been released, this time 
not by Microsoft but by EnSilo Security. This patch protects against the 
[ESTEEMAUDIT remote desktop
exploit](http://blog.ensilo.com/ensilo-releases-free-patch-for-esteemaudit-exploit)
that was released due to the ShadowBrokers exploit leak. While EnSilo feels it
is important to move away from Windows XP, they are releasing this patch because
they feel it is important to control the amount of damage possible due to these
exploits being public.

Windows DID push out an out of band security update this week, fixing [several
vulnerabilities in their Malware Protection
Engine](https://threatpost.com/microsoft-quietly-patches-another-critical-malware-protection-engine-flaw/125951/)
including 3 remote execution flaws.

RoughTed is a malvertising operation that has recently added some new tricks to
avoid ad-blocking. MalwareBytes has [dived in
depth](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2017/05/roughted-the-anti-ad-blocker-malvertiser/),
demonstrating the range of payloads, from malicious chrome extensions, adware,
tech support scams, and other exploit kits.

Google has apparently been expanding their safe browsing initiative. The current
iteration appears to have started [blocking sites that serve logins over
HTTP](https://blog.sucuri.net/2017/05/non-https-websites-blacklisted-for-passwords-without-ssl.html),
further pushing Google's agenda of SSL adoption.

NIST has released a number of new reports this year, including a new report on
[lightweight
cryptography](https://www.nist.gov/publications/report-lightweight-cryptography)
(you know, for all those IoT devices). There are a number of recommendations,
but unfortunate findings such as all NIST approved hashing functions not being
feasible for 8-bit micro-controllers. NIST also points out that the landscape for
crypto and IoT is changing rapidly, and is rethinking their traditional 'crypto
challenge' approach, which has historically taken years.

Interestingly, there has been a bunch of discussion around hashing algorithms
recently, resulting in commentary of ['Maybe we should skip
SHA3'](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2017/05/31/skipsha3.html) and move on to
better algorithms (and maybe stop naming hashing algorithms after SHA, to avoid
confusion), and a dive into two new algorithms for consideration [SHAKE2 and
KangarooTwelve](https://cryptologie.net/article/393/kangarootwelve/).

Security researchers have published a workaround of Email Encryption Appliance 
(EEA)/Email Security Gateway (ESG) setups. This attack works when both items are 
accessible,  allowing an attacker to send email [directly to the email encryption
appliance](https://blog.securolytics.io/2017/05/split-tunnel-smtp-exploit-explained/).
The attack works in two cases, one where the EEA sends messages directly to the
mail server, bypassing the ESG, and the other where the EEA relays emails to the
ESG, but the ESG treats the email as coming from a whitelisted IP. In both
cases, the researchers were able to reliably deliver malicious payloads to their 
targets.

Medical systems have been heavily impacted by security issues in the last year.
A recent audit of pacemaker systems (including pacemakers themselves, monitoring
systems, and programmers) highlights additional problems, with 
several systems being subject to [thousands of known security
vulnerabilities](http://blog.whitescope.io/2017/05/understanding-pacemaker-systems.html)
due to out of date libraries, and in some cases unencrypted patient data being 
accessible from second hand devices the researchers purchased.

Using AWS Electronic Block Storage? Make sure you review your usage of 'public'
snapshots, as you could be leaking [all sorts of information to the
world](https://www.nvteh.com/news/problems-with-public-ebs-snapshots), including
customer data, encryption keys, corporate documents, just to name a few things
that security researchers discovered in a recent investigation.

Crysis ransomware had its [master decryption
keys](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/05/26/crysis-ransomware-master-keys-posted-to-pastebin/)
leaked earlier this week. 

Similarly, so did some encryption keys for the [AES-NI 
ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/aes-ni-ransomware-dev-releases-decryption-keys-amid-fears-of-being-framed-for-xdata-outbreak/).
In this case, the author of the ransomware claims to have released the keys, 
as an attempt to deflect blame for the XData ransomware, which was
built on top of AES-NI. Interestingly, the decryption key for XData has [also
subsequently been
released](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/xdata-ransomware-master-decryption-keys-released-kaspersky-releases-decryptor-/).

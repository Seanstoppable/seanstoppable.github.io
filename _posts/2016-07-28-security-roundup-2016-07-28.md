KeePass, a password management system, is getting a [code 
audit](http://www.ghacks.net/2016/07/22/keepass-password-manager-icode-audit/) 
thanks to a pilot project by the European Parliament. Other projects proposed to 
be audited include the Apache HTTP server, Linux and MySQL.

Do you allow data to be exported as a CSV? Then you might be subjecting your 
users to [CSV injection exploits](https://blog.zsec.uk/csv-dangers-mitigations/). 
Essentially, if someone can insert data that is not sanitized, if it is exported 
and opened by something like Excel, it could execute arbitrary code on the 
recipient's machine.

NIST has issued a new draft of secure communication guidelines, most norably 
tightening up 2-Factor auth recommendations by [suggesting the deprecation of 
SMS 2-Factor auth](https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/25/nist-declares-the-age-of-sms-based-2-factor-authentication-over/?ncid=rss). 
Since social engineering has allowed [call forwarding of SMS 
attacks](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/two-factor-authentication-hacked-shouldnt-panic/) 
this sounds like a good recommendation.

A few stories about bug bounties this week, with Uber [fixing a bug allowing 
customer password resets](http://www.eweek.com/security/uber-flaw-discovery-shows-why-bug-bounty-programs-are-important.html) 
and PHP having [two remote code execution bugs involving the garbage 
collector](http://news.softpedia.com/news/researchers-put-together-php-zero-day-in-order-to-hack-pornhub-506565.shtml).

With the rise of car hacks, the CEO of GM has now said that these incidents are 
not just a consumer or an automaker problem, but [a matter of public 
safety](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601957/gm-ceo-car-hacking-will-become-a-public-safety-issue/). 
This week, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers has apparently released a 
set of security best practices for vehicles. 

Meanwhile, Bruce Schneier has a thoughtful article on [security in the Internet 
of Things](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_uk/read/the-internet-of-things-will-cause-the-first-ever-large-scale-internet-disaster). 
Essentially with the proliferation of connected devices, since they also can 
interact with each other, the footprint of things that can be exploited 
(sometimes in unexpected ways) is expected to increase. Since these devices are 
also automated, this makes it easier for attackers to execute some unintended 
(to the device owner) behavior before they can even react. We have seen this 
with a number of stories in the last year, from the [remote camera 
takeovers](http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/01/how-to-search-the-internet-of-things-for-photos-of-sleeping-babies/) 
to [medical devices being infiltrated](http://www.meddeviceonline.com/doc/medjacking-how-hackers-use-medical-devices-to-launch-cyber-attacks-0001) 
and we should expect those stories to continue.

As an example on how ubiquitous connected systems are..... do you use a wireless 
keyboard? Someone could [eavesdrop on everything you type as well as execute 
keystrokes](https://threatpost.com/keysniffer-vulnerability-opens-wireless-keyboards-to-snooping/119461/) 
from 250 feet away using less than $100 of equipment. Researchers testing a 
number of currently available models found a complete lack of encryption in 8 
out of 12 they tested.

In responsible disclosure news, Google security researchers have discovered a 
[remote execution bug in LastPass](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/07/27/lastpass-password-manager-zero-day-bug-hits-the-news/). 
The two companies are working on a fix.

Talos Intel has a great article on [tracking down ties between different 
malware](http://blog.talosintel.com/2016/07/ransomware-because-opsec-is-hard.html), 
where they discover relationships between Jigsaw, Ranscam and AnonPop.

As always, [Bleeping Computer has the best ransomware 
roundup](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-july-22-2016-stampado-bart-holycrypt-and-more/). 
Beyond the new variants, and unlockers, it appears that the Stampado family that 
was selling for cheap already has a decryptor.

Imagine if you had gone to the trouble of paying for and setting up security 
products, but they weren’t running properly. Malware authors are imagining, and 
making this a reality. [BleepingComputer details 
CertLock](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/certlock-trojan-blocks-security-programs-by-disallowing-their-certificates/), 
a malware strain that prevents new security programs from being installed or 
security products from running, by adding the signing certificates of these 
programs to a special disallowed list in Windows, effectively preventing the 
applications from running. Going farther, it even adds a bunch of update domains 
to the hosts file of a device, redirecting to localhost and breaking update 
capabilities.

Microsoft provides another [security update for older versions of
Windows](https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/06/win-xp-patched-to-avert-new-outbreaks-spawned-by-nsa-leaking-shadow-brokers/)
this week, including XP, Vista and Server 2003, to protect against 3 other
exploits found in the ShadowBrokers exploit dump. Microsoft believes the threat
level of these exploits is severe enough to warrant a wider distribution of the
patches, but points out the best protection is to stop using end of service
versions of Windows. All told, Microsoft released fixes for [97
vulnerabilities](http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/06/ms-tuesday.html)
across all their products, 17 of which were labelled as Critical. Microsoft has
also announced that [SMBv1 will be
disabled](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-to-disable-smbv1-in-windows-starting-this-fall/)
by default for future windows versions.

Interested in a deeper dive into Memory Resident Malware? Endgame security
[delivers this week](https://www.endgame.com/blog/technical-blog/hunting-memory)
covering known attacker techniques, as well as going over
some of the difficulty in detecting these techniques.

Microsoft has discovered malware that [abuses Intel’s Active Management
Technology](https://threatpost.com/platinum-apt-first-to-abuse-intel-chip-management-feature/126166/)
(AMT) to exfiltrate data. Since the AMT is low enough level,
communications through it avoids the application level network stack, and any
monitoring/firewall systems that are operating at that level.

More and more malware is targeting Apple computers. Fortinet researchers have
recently stumbled across 
[MacRansom](https://blog.fortinet.com/2017/06/09/macransom-offered-as-ransomware-as-a-service),
an OSX Ransomware as a service portal. After communicating with the author, they
were given a sample which they then analyzed. Sadly, it looks like any victims
will be unable to decrypt their files, since part of the encryption key is
random, and there is no outbound communication to a C&C.

In some alarming news this week, one security researcher has posted a number of
Man-in-the-Middle vulnerabilities for [several iOS
applications](https://medium.com/@chronic_9612/follow-up-76-popular-apps-confirmed-vulnerable-to-silent-interception-of-tls-protected-data-64185035029f).
These applications talk to unsecured backend services, allowing login
information to be stolen. The applications in question unfortunately range from
grocery deals to voting and banking apps.

The Internet of Things has been demonstrated to be the Internet of VULNERABLE
Things in the last year. Talos Intel does both a
[retrospective](http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/06/the-internet-of-vulnerable-things.html), 
as well as
provides advice to companies that may be purchasing devices connected to the
internet. Case in point, yet another batch of internet enabled web cameras has been
demonstrated to be [riddled with
insecurities](https://safeandsavvy.f-secure.com/2017/06/06/foscam-ip-cameras-insecure-iot/).

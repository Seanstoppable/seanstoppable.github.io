Troy Hunt recently released [unverified 
breaches](https://www.troyhunt.com/introducing-unverified-breaches-to-have-i-been-pwned/) 
for HaveIBeenPwned, due to the recent Badoo breach, where the dataset lies 
  somewhere between a hoax and "can't be conclusively verified". The article is 
  another interesting read in the steps he takes to verify breaches.

Datadog has recently [suffered a potential 
breach](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/2016-07-08-security-notice/), but is 
learning from the other breaches lately by invalidating all user passwords 
proactively.

Wendy's was suspected of a breach in some of their PoS systems starting in 2015, 
and [new reports indicate it is very, very 
bad](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/07/1025-wendys-locations-hit-in-card-breach/), 
with more than 1000 locations impacted. Wendy's currently blames a third party 
service provider that manages the PoS terminals for a number of franchises.

Phishing is still a leading way to gain access to a company. Now, DUO Security 
has launched a free phishing assessment tool called [DUO 
Insight](https://insight.duo.com/). They've also published an [article sharing 
some interesting observations](https://duo.com/blog/now-available-duo-insight-a-tool-to-help-organizations-identify-phishing-risks), 
including that 17% of targetted users actually entered credentials, out of date 
browsers/software detected on end user computers, and a few ways to make a 
phishing attempt more likely to succeed.

Some enterprising researchers recently created some TOR hidden service honeypots 
and, after making a bunch of requests through the TOR, found that their hidden 
services eventually came under attack. Their conclusion: [there are TOR nodes 
designed to spy and find hidden services](https://boingboing.net/2016/07/01/researchers-find-over-100-spyi.html). 
They are scheduled to [present at DefCon](https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-24/dc-24-speakers.html#Noubir) 
this year. While the TOR developers are working to strengthen the system, MIT 
researchers have [announced the development of a potential 
successor](https://news.mit.edu/2016/stay-anonymous-online-0711), building on 
the lessons learned from TOR.

As voice activated assistants become more pervasive, security researchers have 
[demonstrated voice based attacks](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/07/12/rigged-youtube-videos-can-use-siri-and-google-now-to-hijack-your-phone/), 
where they are able to play a muddled video sample that humans can't interpret 
but the voice assistant can. The video demonstrates opening up a website, which 
could introduce additional code to the device.

Microsoft's patch Tuesday includes [this interesting Print Spooler 
exploit](https://threatpost.com/windows-print-spooler-flaws-lead-to-code-execution/119238/) 
where an attacker could write a service to masquerade as a printer and cause a 
machine to download 'printer drivers' which could be any sort of executable that 
the system would trust.

Law enforcement and insurance companies seem to be catching up to the fact that 
[weak electronic vehicle security is leading to an increase in 
thefts](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160706/08341534902/police-slowly-waking-up-to-fact-that-vehicle-network-security-is-joke-to-hackers-thieves.shtml).

As always, [BleepingComputer has the best ransomware 
roundup](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-july-8-2016-alfa-padcrypt-microsoft-decryptor-pizzacrypts-and-more/). 
New families from the makers of Cerber. CryptXXX changes, in that no special 
extension being used to evade detection. CryptoFinancial, a variant that 
actually deletes your files!

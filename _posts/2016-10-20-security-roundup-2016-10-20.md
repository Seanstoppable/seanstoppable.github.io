Not quite as much IoT news this week. The highlight is that Mirai has evolved to [infect cellular modems](http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/10/beware-of-all-powerful-ddos-malware-infecting-cellular-gateways-feds-warn/), including ones that connect automotive and industrial equipment.

Firefox's data collection has indicated that their users see roughly [50% of the internet encrypted](https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/15/firefox-users-chalk-up-https-encryption-milestone/?ncid=rss), in comparison to 40% at the end of 2015. This is at least partially attributed to free SSL provider's like Let's Encrypt.

Security researchers have discovered a vulnerability in some Foxconn hardware used to power several phones. This vulnerability, dubbed ["Pork Explosion"](https://www.hackread.com/pork-explosion-backdoor-in-android-devices/).

HTML5 potentially adds [additional threat vectors to the browser](https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/10/16/html5-introduces-new-security-threats/), in this article that highlights some CORS vulnerabilities, as well as how XSS can enable attacks on local browser storage.

Sophos breaks down [DNS hijacking](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/10/13/popular-bitcoin-site-hit-by-dns-attack-loses-control-of-own-website/), including how easy it could be to just social engineer a hijack. The comparison is to recent SIM card hijacks, with a simple phone call transfering ownership until the actual owner takes steps to recover.

Breakpoint labs details 5 ways in which they [break into a network](https://breakpoint-labs.com/5-ways-we-get-on-your-network/). Phishing, unpatched applications, and poor account policies are no surprise. Poisoning netbios name resolution to collect user and password hashes? That is a bit different. They appear to be going in depth into these topics, with the first being [phishing](https://breakpoint-labs.com/phishing/).

Facebook recently celebrated the [5th anniversary of their bug bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-bug-bounty/facebook-bug-bounty-5-million-paid-in-5-years/1419385021409053). Some interesting stats: More than $5 million paid to 900 researchers over those 5 years. ~$612K of that was this year, due to no fewer than 9K reports since January 1st.

Bleeping computer provides [the ransomware roundup](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-week-in-ransomware-october-14-2016-exotic-lockydump-comrade-and-more/). This week includes a number of new variants, including VenisRansomware which not only encrypts files but includes modules for things like remote access and password stealing. On the defensive side, Talos Group has developed a program that [dumps the configuration of several variants of Locky](http://blog.talosintel.com/2016/10/lockydump.html).
